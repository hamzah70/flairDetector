ok but now seriously we're done forFor those who understand Tamil,  I highly recommend listening to Beela Rajesh from the government's medical committee. The TN government releases figures every evening and she's the one giving it to the press. Very concise speeches and great answers. 

A TL;DW from today's briefing: TN has done a total of  ~3600 tests, with 411 positive cases. 102 positive cases in the last 24 hours out of which 100 is from the conference in Delhi, one having travel history and the last one's tracing is not complete. Several hundred tests are awaiting results. **None of the 411 positive cases are under intensive care.** The government's containment plan - where it is screening those within a 5km (and an additional 3km) radius of a positive case, has surveyed a total population of ~5 lakh.

Big Breaking: Delhi Govt to start random testing in areas of the NCT which are being seen as Coronavirus hotspots.. First state govt to begin random testing.. 1 lakh tests to be conducted in Delhi in the next few days.. well doneIt's been a month today that i gave my employees work from home. I run a small service based company. 
For first 2 years i was opc. Then started with one employee and after 6 i got a team.

This virus affected the people of india in march where they got work from home but we as business owners started getting hit from late January. There were no incoming funds from Feb and no new busines in march. And what can I say about April. May doesn't look bright either.

My company's disaster management fund started getting out from feb and on verge to get exhausted by june. 25k*6 + a co-working space cost which came around 60k for feb and march half month. 

This is unfortunate that this day next month if situation doesn't get better. I'll have to tell them to go on unpaid leave until further notice. 

This is painful. As a human. Coz these people are my people. As a business coz it took me 8 years to be where my company is today. And everything gone in 3 months.

Many companies has laid off their employees already. and in may, its gonna be double.
Stay strong guys. 
Worst days are ahead.Seriously though where is Amit Shah? Is everyone thinking what I'm thinking?So, by Jaggi/Sadhguru - In India every day 8500 people were getting killed in road accidents, last 4 days no deaths (because of lockdown and Coronavirus).

Source video with timestamp: [https://youtu.be/7-9zXLO5JoU?t=981](https://youtu.be/7-9zXLO5JoU?t=981)

If this was true, this would mean that more than 31 lakh people die every year in road accidents. The real number is closer to 1.5 lakhs in a year. The real number per day would be around 400 a day. Not 8500. That's a huge error.

I don't get it. Why do these people have to inflate the numbers to make their points more believable? 400 deaths is not high enough a number to get the point through? And not remembering is not an excuse either. Keep a paper with you with all the facts in it or just don't quote the numbers.

They become the source of fake news.Already people who contacted the virus in Erode and Madurai districts have been traced to the Nizamuddin conference . There were 8 new cases in Erode alone in last two days . 

These are tier 3 cities which are directly linked to rural India. And if we have outbreak on rural India this gonna be deaths in 1000s if we are lucky. There are so many districts /cities in India which will soon be in similar situation.

All because these religious nut jobs can‚Äôt control their shitfest zeal and have to have a conference illegally when the country is trying to control the outbreak.

> According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the coronavirus positive cases reported in large number from slum pockets and highly dense areas of Mumbai. The G/South ward of the BMC has got 78 cases - the largest in the city. In in this ward, most of the patient are reported from fishermen colony of Worli, Prabhadevi and Lower Parel.

> The D ward which has Byculla in its limits, has got the second highest number of cases. Localities such as Dharavi, Kurla, Nehru Nagar, Bandra and Andheri too have significant number of positive cases.

> ""We are more worried and concerned about the health workers and doctors who have been tested coronavirus positive. In Mumbai, more than 50 people from medical fraternity are detected as virus positive. The community spreading has therefore been started as we see a surge in number of cases from various part of the city. They have neither international travel history nor immediate contact. We are declaring these areas as contaminated cluster and subsequently sealing them,"" sais senior BMC officer.

I know lockdown is had been considered necessary all around the world, but here most people don't listen and neither can they afford to listen since the administration has been so slow to provide any aidBangalore : last night I went out to try and get some groceries in the night, around 1... there is a 24x7 shop at a petroleum bunk so thought we can get it from there. But there were cops near ecospace on both sides of the road with barricades and they stopped me. They were asking for a pass which I didn‚Äôt have. 

Cop then showed lots of cars seized on other side of the road and said some section under which criminal cases were filed (289 or something dunno ..) and the cars will be released only after 15 days it seems 

Cop was asking us if we knew there was corona going on and was it really necessary to get out in the night at this time etc... 

Thankfully the cop was a decent chap and after around 10 mins of talking he warned us and let us go back. He spoke softly and didn‚Äôt turn abusive or angry or any of that sort unlike the beating up videos that have been shared here latelyFor any doctors on here:

38-year-old pregnant woman in Maharashtra dies of Covid-19

A 38-year-old pregnant woman from Nalasopara who tested positive for Covid-19, passed away on Monday, officials said.those idiotic 'guidelines' from US 'experts' and WHO were always wrong. Mask saves lives. Always wear one. Fuck what WHO sellouts recommendInteresting excerpts I found in Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray‚Äôs address to the State today:

1> Like Coronavirus there is another virus that is emerging which is threatening social harmony, the virus of fake news & communal hatred.
[source](https://twitter.com/CMOMaharashtra/status/1246389938242781184?s=19)

2> We will save Maharashtra from this corona crisis. But, if someone circulates fake news or videos like commodities or notes being smeared with saliva or with inflammatory content, my law will catch up with them. They will not be spared. Dont do this even for fun.
[source](https://twitter.com/CMOMaharashtra/status/1246390033189187585?s=19)

3> Cases are increasing, but we are trying to be an exception in the world during this pandemic. 

Corona positive cases are rising because of increasing testing. Of the around 500 cases so far, about 51 have been cured and discharged.
[source](https://twitter.com/CMOMaharashtra/status/1246390042047717376?s=19)

4> Like new cases being detected daily, people are also being cured. Unfortunately, there have been some deaths. Those with complications like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, are susceptible to mortality.
[source](https://twitter.com/CMOMaharashtra/status/1246390044971032576?s=19)

5> During the Prime Minister's video-conference, some CMs expressed fears that what happened in Delhi may happen elsewhere. Permission for a similar event in Maharahtra was denied.

6> Till further notice, no permission will be given for cultural, religious and sporting events.

Maharashtra has around 5 lakh migrant labour whose meals, breakfast, medical facilities, have been provided for. Care is being taken of women and children.

> Doing so will help expand clinical research into the drug, Suga said.

> Avigan, developed by a subsidiary of Japan's Fujifilm Holdings, was found in Chinese clinical testing to be effective against COVID-19. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced plans to begin the trial process to have it officially approved as a coronavirus treatment in Japan.

> Fujifilm announced this week it has launched clinical trials to test Avigan's effectiveness against the virus and is preparing to ramp up production. The Japanese government has a strategic reserve of 2 million doses.

Alert from Electrical engineers

Small appeal in the view of PM's call for lighting up lamps on 5th at 9 p.m. While doing this, he has suggested us to keep the lights off. 
But, already, with all the industrial and commercial loads OFF, we have only domestic loads and Essential services loads on the grid. Since, the active (present) lighting load is less than 40% total load, the sudden(simultaneous) switching-off of all the lights on the grid may lead to power collapse (due sudden drop of huge load). So, please, advise people to keep some loads such as fridges and ACs ON. If the grid gets collapsed, then all the hospitals which are treating the patients may lose their critical power supply. Please forward this to everyone to save the Grid.Say bye to mountain view, Jalandhar residents.Damn, we hit 500 today as well.

> Kerala on Friday became the first state in India to procure rapid testing kits from Hong Kong. These kits will enable faster testing in case of community transmission of the coronavirus (covid-19). They can test thousands of samples in some minutes.

> ""The current tests are designed to find genetic material from the virus by testing a person's nose and throat samples, that indicate an ongoing infection but will take days depending on the facilities and technicians available. The rapid tests can resolve this delay to just 20 minutes to two hours,"" said Amar Fettle, doctor and Kerala's nodal officer in the task force to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

> ""Rapid tests check for protective antibodies in a finger prick of blood. It could indicate exposure to infection. But there are two catches: the antibody that the kit detects can take up to seven days to develop after infecting someone, and the final confirmation could only be obtained through the regular testing. Even then, it can be an important tool to check for prevalence and trend of immunity in a small community, like to see if migrants and doctors have developed antibodies,"" said Fettle.

Spent last night researching on this, I am not a biology student or understand microbiology, but in layman's terms, this compound which is basically sort of a replica of the protein (ACE2) that covid-19 binds itself to when it enters the human body. This drug is supposed to be taken via IV. 

This will basically, ask the virus to attach to itself rather than the actual ACE2 which is the protection layer in our lungs. 

So the favorable outcome, please correct me if i am wrong, would be that viral load would reduce and it will allow the body to fight the virus better. 

This seems very promising as per me and they had already done a study back in 2009 and the outcome was as per what the researchers expected. The current study is happening in three european countries with 200 patients. This seriously seems to be a glimmer of hope. I am just confused as to why it is not being spoken about much.

> **Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study**

> Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. 

> We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. 



> https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1

India started mass BCG immunisation in 1948. This is not a definite proof, but something we can be optimistic about. 

Another theory is the ""hygiene hypothesis"". A lot of complications from Covid-19 like ARSD are not caused by the virus but body's own immune response. The theory is that living in ""unhygienic environment"" trains your body's immune response to be better/accurate, so it does not go haywire when faced with something like Covid-19. This could mean lower mortality in poorer countries.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you‚Äôre ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that‚Äôs ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you‚Äôve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It‚Äôs ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don‚Äôt have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it‚Äôs absolutely essential. Don‚Äôt take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people ‚Äî in your home, or in a car, because you‚Äôre on your way to see a doctor (and only after you‚Äôve called first) ‚Äî wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven‚Äôt just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don‚Äôt share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you‚Äôre touching anything that might carry the patient‚Äôs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Motive is to make this resource wiki as simple and accessible as possible.Can someone make the Coronavirus video by Kurgesazt available in local Indian languages? It would be very helpful. IMO that video is the most comprehensive video on COVID19 there is.I have developed something very similar to this 

 [http://corona.politicl.com/](http://corona.politicl.com/)Translation needed: 

Kurgesagt's video on Coronavirus; This video needs to be redone for indian context and translated as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY 

just adding subtitles to the above video won't help:
> People here cannot easily understand some of stuff happening in graphics easily (the visual metaphors they use can be quite complex for many people).

> Some parts need to be remade to fit the local context (""Clean your hands as if you just handled jalapenos and you need to put in your contact lenses next."" - A powerful analogy but one that will be lost on most people here.).

> Subtitles stay on Youtube, they don't get carried over to WhatsApp groups.

> So just subtitles won't help here.

Send them all back. Let them fester in the communal hellscape they want to turn India into the with the rest of us.Holy shit!there are more Islamist than secular on this thread!

edit:-

what?why the downvote!

insulting religion should be a fundamental right irrespective of religion!

be it hinduism or  islam or  toothfairy-ism...

but instead people are orgasming over the fact a guy was caught for insulting islam!  
so yeah they are islamists!Insulting Islam (or any other religion for that matter) is not a bad thing to do. There are lot of things that are wrong with Islam, and we should be able to attack or satirize against it using harsh language if we choose to. Doing so is not bigotry.

The problem is when criticism or satire of Islam descends into hatred of Muslims, as in the case of some of the people in this story.[deleted]Arresting people for auch things is bad, that's pretty authoritarian.

The coronavirus outbreak has forced governments to put in place policies to contain the spread of 
the disease among their population. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collects 
publicly available information on 11 indicators (S1-11) of government response:

1. school closure;
2. workplace closures;
3. public event cancellation;
4. public transport closure;
5. public information campaigns;
6. restriction on internal movement;
7. international travel controls;
8. fiscal measures;
9. monetary measures;
10. emergency investment in healthcare;
11. investment in vaccines.

They took 7 indicators to publish the above.  Its the harshest action any govt has sofar taken.

They havent taken other things to consideration . But thats not the point. as  Its strigncy index.The lockdown has certainly reduced the rate of transmission but it's too early to conclude that the low number of confirmed cases as the virus being successfully contained. The rate of testing in India is abysmally low and so the ground reality could be much worse than appears. The is also report of people dying with similar symptoms being refused test because there's lots of samples pending for test. And so the number of deaths probably is under-counted as well.

Also there's no universal criteria for testing. Different countries have taken different approaches with respect to testing and counting of casualties. So the numbers don't say  much about the efficacy of the measures being taken. Unless widespread testing or random testing is done, it's difficult to know the true severity of the situation.This is only valid if we believe that we have successfully tested all the people infected with the virus and sadly, it's probably not the case due to the lack of test kits in the initial phase. 

So, this graph will become less impressive if accurate data were used.",1586509327.0,fyc91z,Coronavirus,13,/r/india/comments/fyc91z/oxford_covid19_government_response_trackersource/,40,,OXFORD COVID-19 GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRACKER.(Source in comment),https://i.redd.it/6alqo1jwgyr41.jpg

If they are one of those oldies who expect to live with their son and grandkids., then try to make some arrangement later without compromising with your privacy.

If they want you to become your matchmaker in exchange of what they did for you, then God help ??Pay off their debts if they have any. Sometimes, take them out for a nice movie and have a nice dinner. Spend time with them. I'm sure that is all your parents would want from you :-)Not necessarily. Depends on the individual. Why not ask them directly?My dad didn't invest all his life savings on my business for me to pay back but more to ensure a comfortable life ahead. That's how he wants his child to live.
Yes, I have my differences with him and we fight quite a lot. But that does not mean he is now expecting a pay back. 

My pay back to him is, being with him and ensuring he gets every comfort when he is old. When he fell sick, I tried to ensure - I get him the best medical analysis that I could afford. That's all. Knowing someone will be around and he is not alone.

I think, that's more than enough a gesture, if it comes from within and that's one thing I hope he does not hate about me and gives him comfort. 

You'll know what your parents expect out of you. That will be your pay back, I guess.Spend your time with them, that's all parents wants from their kids. Never leave them and that's the most you could pay them for.Get them.something like a house or a car.

They will never accept money from you.

You can also take out insurances in their name I think or send them to a nice vacation after all this covid 19 pandemic is overPay it back with a little effort. 

Get them the highest speed internet connection. Give them access to the music, movies and tales of their time!

Get yearly health plans such as Practo Plus. Give them the power of healthcare. 

Get rid of daily household chores - Buy a Frontload washing machine, Maybe a dishwasher, a top of the line vacuum cleaner, Alexa/Google Home. 

Ask them of what they wanted as a kid, and bring it to them!

You never pay back money with money, you pay them back by caring for them like they cared for you :)Just be nice to them in their old age. Remember your mistakes which they tolerated
Explain nicely when you don't agree with their opinion about something.
Try to do mostly as they say as long as it makes sense.
Always greet them and keep them smiling.
Always take their calls on priority even for trivial issues.
Don't send them to an old age home everLook after them n take care of them like they did when you were growing up. I think they‚Äôll appreciate that more. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt need the money which they spent on you back. Just my opinion.Create a fund - through investment or whatever form you would prefer. And let them get the interest or the earnings on it. That is what I have done. Don‚Äôt know if correct but would want to see what others might have done. 

I have also applied for them to permanently move abroad to where I am based. Hopefully that works out.My sister graduated last year and tried to give her college fees money back to my Dad, my dad refusedGive them thoughtful gifts. Take them around the world. Make them happy.No it‚Äôs not offensive. 

Just give it back ASAP and don‚Äôt waste time by asking a bunch of strangers about it. 

Almost comes across like your seeking validation more than anything, if not praise for your intentions. 

Don‚Äôt do it coz you can tell everybody else about it, if you feel like it‚Äôs the right thing to do, then just do it. 

And when the time comes and you have spent a shite ton of money on ur kids education and upbringing, don‚Äôt expect the kid to pay you back in kind, so keep that in mind and most importantly, don‚Äôt go around telling everyone you paid back your parents upbringing costs, that would be more insulting to your parents than you actually paying them.Yes. Always remember their sacrifices and respect them. You can aren't expected to pay back your parents monetarily. You are supposed to take care of them in their old age and look after them very well.

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, ‚Äúdiscovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app‚Äôs phone call function.‚Äù As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group ¬†is ‚Äúactively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.‚Äù   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors ¬†like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

This is normal expected behaviour but given their past, we must be appreciative of this cooperative stance taken by themWait, what?[removed]This is a RSS classic. The footmen on the ground, the Godi Media, everyone unnamed will run narrative after narrative demonizing a target.

RSS head comes out and puts out a statement saying the most rational left leaning statement.

*world: pikachu_surprised.jpg*

Narrative goes one like nothing happened.RSS needs Tablighi , Tabligi needs RSS, both are theological based tribalism and each feed the other feeding suspicion and fear slowly poisoning society and creating theological base for them to feed on.

Fuck them both.Well said, RSS, credit where credit's due.They said these things too

Baad mai chhupe rehna, chhupana, jo jaanch kaarane ke liye aa rahein hai unki sewa ke liye unse behooda vyvahar karna, ye toh kuch vikruti ka hee darshan hai (to hide afterwards, to misbehave with those examining them, reflects some form of perverseness),‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúThe way they are spitting is against the parampara (tradition) of India. Agar galti se kisi ko paer lagta hai toh hum namaskar karte hai (even if our feet accidentally touches someone, we apologise),‚Äù he added, stating, however, that the Tablighi members‚Äô conduct was not a reflection on the entire community.

This is incorrect. They were as stranded as anyone after the lockdown because they went to masjids to preach and didn't have accomodations. Some were scared of coming out as from the community to be tested because of the backlash from everywhere. 

Even a lot of them were wrongly accused of misbehavior which was exaggerated where true and made up in other cases just because the media jumped on the hate bandwagon.
Luckily many police Twitter accounts clarified and made fake news media delete their claims.

Unfortunately all this made it further difficult to track and isolate them quickly enough to avoid spread to others. 

All that was needed was simple cooperation which would've made everything easier. Of course the non cooperation by few could be punished. But by singularly making claims that ALL of jamaat members are non cooperative etc..they just scared the shit out of them.

Don't people run away from quarantine?
Is it always because they're bad?
I think even thousands jamaat members suffered because of behavior of hardly few.This might be just lip service service though.[deleted]All hail the Nazis for taking a 5 minute break from doing Nazi things and saying something resembling basic humanity.

And it's not sarcasm. They mean it. I confirmed.

THAT is how dangerously sentimental, shallow and schizophrenic this country is.

7. Essential service were not classified properly (see what happened to sanitary pad factories) and this may be a result of that. Or it maybe that people have hoarded pet food and supply chain disruption has prevented it from coming.
8. Yes.1. The bets are on herd immunity. Second wave is generally not the same intensity as the first one. They probably think it is manageable.

2. Accountability isn't really a part of our policies. It never was either.

3. Sadly, no one knows the answers. No one knows what's to come. Support from family is likely the only savior. But people might soon realize that it doesn't take a hell lot to sustain. I am talking about the salaried class here. Not the daily wage class. 

4. People aren't going to be concerned unless it's in the neighborhood. The moment a person from your apartment complex has it, you stop going out. The best policy for a person right now is to act as if everyone has it.

5. India did send HCQ to a lot of other nations as well. Read Yuval Noah Harari's article about world during, after COVID-19. He explains why global support is absolutely necessary.

6. Reality would always be less (and delayed) than what govt. promises on paper.

7. No idea. Pet food production itself might've stifled. It's highly likely that it won't be in priority list of our government.

8. Lots of time to spend.

Just giving my thoughts.",1586510164.0,fycg7l,Coronavirus,5,/r/india/comments/fycg7l/questions_on_my_mind_because_of_the_lockdown_and/,8,"1) Read that China üá®üá≥ ended their lockdown a few days ago, how does that work exactly? There‚Äôs no cure for Covid-19 yet.. what‚Äôs to stop anyone there from catching it again and repeating the cycle? 

2) PM cares relief fund : been getting a lot of forwards/ seeing praised on social media about who donated what amount and all... I thank them sincerely. Also, what‚Äôs happened to that amount? How is it being utilised and who‚Äôs benefiting from it? 

3) Jobs that aren‚Äôt paying salaries to their employees. How are those people and their families supposed to get by? How will they pay rent, bills and loans? (I know some banks have paused collecting EMIs for 2-3 months, but that communication was made via E-mail, I don‚Äôt think the majority of Middle Aged and Senior citizens would update themselves by checking their mailbox) 

4) I live in Bangalore and once A week, I  go to get essentials and each time, I see that the main road is sort of packed even during late afternoon and people are just sitting outside closed shops and are basically chilling, idk why the seriousness of this disease isn‚Äôt getting to everyone yet? And also the panic buying during each announcement of any lockdown or curfew. It‚Äôs less survival of fittest, and more survival of the douche-est. 

5) And that HCQ drug, what was that drama even for? It was evident he‚Äôd get it since Trump and Modi are basically FaceTime buddies at this point. 

6) The govt has been announcing different things (hold off rent, pay salaries, free ration, random people spraying things in ‚Äúmain roads‚Äù who also don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre spraying), anyways.. when are these things getting implemented? What is the solution for the middle class people who need that salary or have to pay rent? 

7) Why are they locking out pet food? Cz my local shop was pretty empty when I went in last week and had to buy different brands of food cz they were out and claimed that no new stock is coming in till this is clears up.

so any doctor who does not want to die because of the fucked up insensitive and irresponsible system can just call it out on social media?The issue isn't just about ppe. My friend lives where this took place and had to go there in the past when his wife was pregnant. It seems that every time he'd visit with his wife, there'd be a new gynaecologist (one was suspended, one was transferred on her request). 

Apparently the current staff are very inexperienced doctors brought in by the local MLA at the last minute as part of some government initiative to conduct vasectomy. Then this guy who was supposed to give anesthesia refused to do it saying that being the most senior doctor, he'd become the scapegoat if anything goes wrong. Since then, it became fully political with the opposition ex minister backing him. A couple of days back, he met the ex minister who asked him to appear in front the media and he gave a scathing review of how the hospital is being run. The ruling party is crying foul stating he is a an opposition party plant.

I also believe him when he says that the cops are treating doctors badly. I've seen a doctor get stopped by an SI and when he said that he is a doctor.... The cop just said ""so??""... The doctor then started taking out his ID card while explaining something but the cop wouldn't listen.He must be glad he‚Äôs out of the shitfest.In an India-oriented subreddit, discussing how an Indian doctor was suspended for speaking out about the lack of PPE, somehow ""China"" seems to creep into the conversation.

Unless they strictly follow safety precautions. Only the HAZMAT SUITS OFFER THE ULTIMATE PROTECTION. And getting PPE in large amounts may not be possible.

Whenever he gets a chance, he would use/manipulate people to feed the hatred to channels. He has enough media to support him. It is beyond doubt that most of the government hospitals are ill equipped, not for covid-19, but even for day to day treatment in normal days. Government doctors are no saints, by any measure. CBN just exploits the situation. Earlier he did the same with a stage artist during farmer protests. This time he used a doctor (who belongs to backward caste). Now the government is in bind. If it takes an action against the doctor, it would be portrayed as against BCs during the C-19 infection. Even if CBN is in power, it would be same. However, he has media support and whatever he does, gets glorified. No one knows the facts.üôè

Hey Doctor,

    Pls, we know how bad it is. And we sympathize with you, and yr daring work. Pls equip yr self with weapons. Yes that is right. You heard me. Screw the masks, screw everything. Use make do  with things, but weaponize yrself. This will look like a war zone, and it is one. When we are in war zone we have no choice. Modiji needs yr help

    So, pls Try to use Hydroxychloroquine HCQ prophylactically, and if any medical staff is positive, pls use Azithromycin as well. All over USA and the world they are using it, and have seen marked improvement. So, we need HCQ. 

ICU
üôèYes that is true. Medical staff do NOT need banging thalis, and clapping, and turn off lights etc etc. They need equipment masks etc etc. and most importantly HCQ, and Azithromycin in abundance. And if any med staff has heart, lung, or morbid illnesses, pls send them to other parts and not near covid19. Or send them home on paid leave. Also pls educate yr medical staff that as per S.Korean study feb 2020, the covid19 is an AIRBORNE illness. Covid19 germ size is 0.07 micrometers much below airborne threshold of 10 um. Which could mean that the covid19 could spread anywhere in the hospital, if no designated rooms exist for airborne disease patients, with negative airflow.Sorry, but guys this post is completely misleading, BTW actually the PPE suits & masks are completely ready, even one of our main town tenali is leading producer of PPE Kit's & also another place called AP MEDITECH(launched by cat beard CBN 2 year's ago which is primarily focused on bio-medical research) had developed portable COVID19 testing kit(PCR) which can show results in 55 minutes.

Our Process:
1) Requests received from hospitals are put in queue after verifying it is sent from a legitimate email address from a person in authority.  
2) We ask the hospital to get a quote from their vendor for the quality and quantity they need.  
3) We allocate funds for this as per the current amount raised and pay the vendor who will deliver the goods directly to the hospital - this will be against a GST invoice.  
4) Once a hospital receives the goods we will request them to share pictures and it's acknowledgement.  

So far we are working with the Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital (Delhi) and Hindu Rao Hospital. Urgent items required by them are PPE Kits (10,000 required), ICU PPE Kits (1,000 required) and Sanitisation Tunnels at hospital entrances.

75,TWO-WHEELER-MAFIA,"I don't understand why they don't use money from contingency fund .. there's a separate fund called contingency fund 


>
Contingency Fund of India:
This fund is being held by the President of India. He can spend from this fund for emergency and unforeseen circumstances. No authorization from Parliament is required,

Public Accounts of India:
1. Bank savings account of the departments/ministries
2. National Investment fund
3. National Calamity & contingency fund (NCCF)
4. National small savings fund, defence fund.¬¨¬¨
5. Prarambhik Shishak Kosh, MNREGA fund
6. Provident fund, Postal insurance etc. and so on
No permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account.

Consolidated Fund of India:
All the cash from direct and indirect taxes, all the loans that are taken by the government of India and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government. This is the largest of all three funds. The government needs parliament's approval to spend money from this fund
>The amount of money we pay as our taxes... They use it to gain goodwill for their parties(state or center) by freeing loans, water, electricity, transport and even their election campaigns. So in the time of actual needs, they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis.The Govt of India (central Govt.) runs a fiscal deficit every year. This means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise. Note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs.

The GoI doesn't earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to a multitude of factors. India has a large unorganised ""off the books"" sector which doesn't pay taxes, the Indian state doesn't have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them, etc. This results in the only reliable revenue streams for the Govt being salaried tax payers, GST collected and some other taxes. From this, GST payments have been less than projected because the Govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post-GST.

Now, a large chunk of the Govt.'s expenditure goes into schemes for the ""upliftment of the poor"" and ""rural development"", etc etc. The problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself. By the 'state' I mean people who are a part of the state, ie: politicians and bureaucrats.

So taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism, to gain favour with the electorate so they're elected again, etc. A lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption. Bureaucrats tasked with building 10 toilets might only build 2 and pocket the funds allocated for the other 8.

This is how taxpayer money in India is only used to serve politicians' and bureaucrats' interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society 'uplifted'.

There is no accountability and no transparency.potholed roads, slow public transport, namesake education and healthcareIt's not a begging bowl. It's a psychological tactic, they know you'll donate when the country is going through a crisis ""even when we have enough money to handle the crisis"" and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks.
>The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?


Because generations of people before you decided a spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our Indian culture. Now,those with spines exploit,and everyone spineless suffers. Blame the populace.thats where all the govt employees come from.Because if they have to give out from the government's kitty, it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot.India is poor - its a banal and boring answer but it is still true.

India needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels.

India needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure (non corrupt officers, people used to following the law - the habits of civilization)

Our tax income isn't superb. Our usage of money isn't super - we leak all over the place.

This means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during a crisis.

It also gives people a way to help - which is what most civilized people do. They feel bad when they see someone in trouble, and want to help, This is one way to do so.Dont you ever question where your tax money goes. cant you see the tallest and most beautiful statue that has a natural cooling system whenever it rains, was built in India. Which country provides this much comfort ?It's called corruption bro. How else will they get their chai-paaniI agree with this line, ""Bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during (a) time of crisis.""

My sentiments exactly!Not to mention the taxpayer money spent on statues. And meaning less parks.  The statue of unity alone cost around 3k crores. Bhenchod us ne bhi apna nhi banaya tha inko pata nhi kyun copy karni h har western cheezDon't forget that 3000cr statue and 20,000cr Rajpath renovation.
And why the fuck politicians don't pay tax?It's surprising nobody has realised that PM Cares is a scam. PMRF is legit. It gets audited. PM Cares is shady AF. Just like those election bonds they sold, a large-scale money laundering scheme. Just boosts Bee Jay Pee's MLA buying capabilities.I think in India corruption, mismanagement in govt. projects looses a lot of money. Also a lack of discipline in finances populist measures etc are other major drains. None of those in power till date have shown courage to tackle these issues.

We have each one blaming others of corruption but no one even making an attempt to stop it.

Thus there is always shortage of money when need arises maybe it could be a political decision too, people donate to show their loyalty.All money went to Statue of Unity!Well once you agree to unmonitored political funds and donations. Once you agree to non independent audit and investigate agencies and judiciary.

Once you agree to various political parties subsidizing religious events and setting up monuments to their preferred leader/ ideology.

Once you agree to systems that don't have accountability.

Once you agree to unmonitored subsidies. 

Once you vote on various ideology rather than holding developmental goals and their fulfillment as the metric.

Then saala paisa bacha kahan.. sab toh kharch huwa / kha pee kar dakar gayain.since there is no accountability, they can say and do whatever they want. And our dumbass society thinks of political employees as patriarchs and bow down to them unconditionally.They build statuesTax ka paisa se vote ka expenses chalta hai. Mandeer banta h. Gundaraj chalta h. Statue banta hai. Personal expenses chalta hai. India has so much excise duty on electronic items. Laptops, cameras mobiles are cheaper in other countries like Us or uae. Luxury cars has huge import duty in india. Now we pay gst as well.Guys, I know it's sometimes easy to forget this our urban middle class bubble, but India is a poor country. We have massive rural population who are far poorer than most of us have even seen.  

Even in the best of times without any special events like floods, terrorism, viruses, lakhs of people simply die of hunger in India. An average of 25 lakh to be precise. We are a country who cannot even afford to feed a pretty sizable portion of our population under normal circumstances.  

What the tiny urban middle class pays in tax goes into the normal functioning of the country, but it's far from enough.

Edit: Not trying to defend our government spending, before anyone gets that impression. Our governments do spend what little precious money they have on pointless things.WTF? If they save our tax-money to solve pandemics, how the fuck are they gonna build statues?>The fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaries of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security?

inefficient .....Yes.   Incompetent & under qualified ....mostly No. At least half of the government employees (those who are not selected through reservation quota) are fully competent and qualified as in most cases they have fought through cut-throat competition in examinations and interviews (although a very small percentage of govt. jobs are still got through connections and bribes) .

The term ""underperform"" also does not apply  exactly like private sector for most of the government organisation.. for example say post office, the mandate of a post office is to deliver mail, and provide people with a savings account or PLI, and some additional shit like electricity, telephone bill payments etc. the peak of the ""performance"" in case of a post office employee is, when all of the citizens approaching him/her are able to avail services of postoffice satisfactorily. 

So applying the term ""underperform"" for government employees is not similar to private companies where quarterly numbers, profit, year on year growth and so many other criteria of competitive markets are applicable when assessing the ""performance"" of an employee.

And as for where your money goes. Government employees also pay all the taxes you have mentioned. Where and how  the money is utilised is a political decision not a bureaucratic one.My best guess is that most people who own the most of the money in the system don't pay enough or not pay at all. So the tax payers money is completely used up while tending to everyday stuff. That's why there's little to no funding during crisis times. And not to forget corruption.Finally someone who voices the same question that I have!!And most importantly if I am paying taxes, I should know where my money is spent.Read about NHAI, FCI. 

Read about how 75% of revenue expenditure of govt is salaries and pensions. 

Read about how there are hundreds of government companies in losses which are subsidised by the govt. 

Read about how government banks are recapitalised with no change in how they function.

You‚Äôll realise the problem is that the government plays too much of a role.>Why does the government come with a begging bowl during every crisis?

Sara paisa toh ye madarchod nirav modi aur vijay malya jaise log le jate

And all this happens right under their noses aur jab sale bhag jate toh randi rona karte.Privatize the profits and socialize the lossesThere is corruption in India. I don't disagree with that.

But I can also think of more than a dozen possible avenues where our tax might be spent. There is the electricity bills of all our government buildings..the parliament and so on.

We not only pay your so called "" incompetent bureaucrats"" but we also pay our defense forces and doctors from the same money

Not to mention the countless subsidies.. LPG, petrol, diesel and the ration shops. Pulses, rice and other food materials are sold at really subsidized rates

Education in government schools is free and they provide free meals to children in many states. The government engineering, medical colleges, the IITs, do you think they run only on the money collected as fees. Think twice and compare the exorbitant fees collected in private colleges and the fees in government colleges.


We cant say that there has been zero development. The road network and rail network is pretty good.

The government hospitals, primary health centres.. all these run on tax money..the personnel there don't work for free.

And the people of India need incentives to take proper care of their daughters. There are a lot of female oriented schemes.. free education for single girl child and many others. Indians need to be paid or bribed for doing their duty.

As someone below mentioned less than 2 percent actually pay taxes. Tax evasion is sadly what most Indians do.

The Government is forced to tax all products only then can the ordinary Indian man live a okayish life.

So think twice before swearing up and down that your tax money is disappearing and  for the person who said he is okay paying flat 30 percent as taxes.. calculate properly and take the time to digest the amount.  (A salary of 6L will generate a tax of 1.8L)Corruption is real but IMO, the revenue you're talking about is already reserved for different portfolios in the annual budget, health care is one of them, but no country considers a pandemic/natural calamity while formulating the budget.

Thus, some extra funds that the public provides in the prospect of these PM and CM relief funds always helps. Also, it's always one's personal choice to donate or not, and I believe nobody should really have a problem with it.Doesn't india have a sovereign wealth fund of some sort....Just don't donate anything into the begging bowlYou mad, bro? Taxes are for corrupt contractors and friends/family of politicians to loot. This is for something else entirely.Top of that PM funds is not transparent at all. There are only 3 people who will be controlling these funds Modi, Amit and sitaraman, with no accountability it can be easily misused.

I request everyone to not donate there, instead help in your local areas, where you could see your funds utilized immediately or some good NGO who are feeding poor every day, this is what  I have done!Meanwhile they give away 90% of India's medicines to the white man for free so that they can kiss ass and get a pat on the head from Trump and his white nationalist crowd.Waiting for bhakts to comment, ""oNlY 0.0000000000000001% iNdIaNs PaY tAxEs"".The government should make up its mind whether India is rich and swimming in money or if we're poor and desperately lacks funds.

If we are so poor, why then waste tax money on statues and monuments. Why does the government spent 1000s of crores on advertising. The government also uses tax money as transaction fees on electoral bonds. Why destroy growth with pointless exercises like demonatisation. How much growth in J&K has the government destroyed with the lockdown in J&K.To the chutiya members of IT cell who are coming here and downvoting this stuff. Bc it's a crisis time. People are asking question for your family only. How fucking stupid do you have to be to mass downvote this stuff even now. Grow a brain.Because we are highly overpopulated country. Reduce the population and most of the problems will get resolvedYou know it stems down to two things. Corruption and incompetence. These two vices in our political system is killing any hopes of progress.This is why I haven't given a dime to this so-called PM cares fund. Government of India is rich af, they just need to keep their priorities right.first of all you should understand that the % of people paying taxes in this country is very small ( 5.52 crore individuals (people) were among those who filed returns in 2017-18). Compare that with our general population which is 130 crore which is 4% of the total population. of course you have companies, firms and other entities which pay tax apart from individuals which adds to the overall taxes collected. but still the number is very very small.

You should understand that these are the people and entities who opted to file and/or pay tax. you still have a large portion who make money and don't pay taxes for obvious reasons. this is one of the reasons why the govt. has indirect taxes in place, meaning you pay tax on almost everything you buy, whether is a pack of cigarettes to a car to phones, etc. The govt. needs money to run the country as it incurs expenses for a variety of things (administrative costs, cost for building and maintaining infrastructre, healthcare, govt. schemes, etc.).

The problem here is two fold: 1. a lot of people and entities withhold their incomes and don't pay tax. and (2) whatever tax is collected by the govt. is not used properly for it's intended purpose due to corruption. so when people like you or me, who pay taxes on time, obviously do not get what we pay for from basic proper roads to effective crisis management.

so, in essence, in a system that's inherently bad, only the bad will win. the good is seen as an anomaly or even as a hindrance. so while we pay taxes on time as we are morally obliged and to avoid being hounded by the IT dept., the people who don't pay taxes and the politician who swindles tax money in the name of executing public projects, are the real winners.

&#x200B;

edit: 5.52cr of 130 crore is 4%

haan haan i can't do math for nuts -\_-To protect jumlabaaz, tadipar, pisht, etc. gangs, government spends 5000 crores

To build aadhaar scam infrastructure, government wasted 5 billion dollars of tax payers money

They spend 5000 crores on adverting their accomplishments

Foreign trips budget may also be 5000 crores.

They spend 1000 crores for trading MPs, MLAs, etc.

They are very extravagant in spending tax payer's money.They spend it on free schemes.Maybe because most Indians try tooth and nail to evade taxes and during a crisis the government can actually guilt-trip them into coughing up some money. Although, I'd guess it's still the salaried folk making more individual donations but can't blame the government for trying.They have funds to make statues hence i don't trust PM FUND at all that too via Paytm.It‚Äôs a feature and not a bug of the Socialist Republic of India.The tax money was spent on statues & foreign trips.It's strange cause no one knows where the money is going too, and the taxpayers money is used on ads and building giant statues...i didn't donatedMalya and Modi took most of the money, remaining money I feel is distributed between political parties :(We can say that they are spending money for illicit purposes. But the taxes we levy won't be enough to take care of our huge population.Tax collected last year - 25 lakh crores
Country‚Äôs population - 130 crores

Spendable amount per capita: ~ ‚Çπ19,000

Enjoy.This I think can qualify as a good rant.

Observations:

A) our standards and revenue  - being exposed to a lot of western media, our standards have gone up. Rightly so. We however forget that the western countries do collect a very high level of taxes in a very effective way. I am against demonetization, GST and it‚Äôs botched implementation, however we do all have to agree that our standards expectations do not line up with the macroeconomic fiscal financial efficiency 

B) Ineffective disbursement - the taxes that the government does collect get disbursed and deployed very ineffectively. There is political bias, populist bias, corruption, transparency issues, precedent (judiciary/law enforcement) is weak. Overall, ineffective 

C) Priorities- the priorities shift quite rapidly too. Sometimes they become business first, then defense first, then welfare first, then politicians first (pun-intended). They are however never consistently about education, healthcare, science and development, social welfare etc

D) The illiterate executive - well if your HRD minister believes in mythical conspiracies, your health minister in the prowess of cow dung and your welfare minister is not even qualified - you have a perfect mess on hand. The PM himself can‚Äôt fully explain his qualifications except for chai, pakoda, gareeb and patriotic 

Anywho, it always comes down to ‚Äúit is not about what the country can do for me, it is always about what I can do for the country‚Äù. If you feel PM Cares doesn‚Äôt sit well with your conscience, do your own thing. Do it in the name of your human empathetic self, else just sit home - watch Netflix and chill!!NRI here. You guys don't pay enough tax. We pay 30% income tax on top we pay shit ton of other taxes. Believe me, you guys don't.well, the portion of country that pays taxes is a small sliver. Almost most people who are not salaried employess don't pay close to what they should as taxesTaxes are not only for the time of Pandemic if you open your eyes and see what the government does. Then you will be surprised to see that there are many essential things which the government has made. And I guess you are one of those people who cry for unity and peace and brotherhood amongst the citizen of the country. So  why are you not willing to pay for your brother's who are in need of those funds right now.People in every country pay taxes and this is the time every government all over the globe needs money to fight this crisis which has drastic impact on every country, economy and people. The crisis is huge which perhaps you and me cannot even image. I would suggest stop criticizing and start contributing. How much money are you paying qs taxes?, I am asking this reading your language as if you have paid crore of taxes and haven't got enough? And how many people pay taxes? And what do you mean by the govt has come with a begging bowl? Who has asked you for money? I hate people who use social media to just spread negativity especially in the moments of crisis like this and own no responsibility instead of always blaming the govt..Just because I pay tax ‚Äúa‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean I am free from paying an income tax. You have to understand that the taxation systems need everything to operate as intended to work. All your countries with free health care have very high IT taxes in addition to the sales taxes. It‚Äôs is economically impossible to give all the benefits you ask in addition to the population and resources we have.

I totally agree that our politicians are corrupt and eat up so much of what we get but you cannot compare countries like HongKong to India because it‚Äôs absurd because if population and resource perspective. 

Scandinavian countries, Canada and all those that provide free healthcare , figure out what‚Äôs the common denominator in them?Now you are an anti national. LolüòúThey cut 1 day salary of every govt employee to raise fund during flood and other disaster, and they collected money from govt employees during this outbreak too.Because people become hoarders and selfish themselves during every crisis. You want more money circulating during crisis because circulation dips due to one time buys. Govt begs so to atleast make a percentage of these chutiyas reduce their hoardings and donate some wealth into the economy. All govts work in debt and these crisis are almost always unpredictable. Even with a trillion dollars they can't build maglev trains overnight.Because less the 20% of population pay taxesIts because all the money govt has goes in buying new buses which people burnt.Government doesn't get enuff money from taxes.

And currently we have around 1.6 Lakh people are under observation. 
But it's too early to say the flattening the curve thing, but we should appreciate the people doing good job.Actually they updated their testing strategy today:

> a. Within 7 days of illness ‚Äì rRT-PCR

> b. After 7 days of illness ‚Äì Antibody test (If negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR)Just getting news of finding  of people were corona affected after death  makes it crystal clear for me. Just a heard a news of that in Karnataka as well where see such a low number of positive people.It‚Äôs not true from what I have seen ..Police are following up with people who have been present in the area of around Nizammudin (railway station in this case on 15th March) and asking if they‚Äôre having symptoms or anyone in their contact..I think it‚Äôs a a pretty good follow up and will result in effective mapping.After some time, we'd stop giving a damn about people dying around us.Even with such restrictive testing, we have a very low positive percentage of corona cases (4-5%), while it is close to 20% for both Italy and USA. 

If according to your assumption there would have already been widespread community transmission, then this number could never have been this small. Also, a situation where one day has shown a huge spike in this percentage has also not happened here, like it did in the UK where it was close to 50 percent for a few days.Community spread will open the gates of hell. To show that sab changa se, gov will undertest and manipulate numbers just like china. After a while wola no cases just like wuhan.When Iceland was largely tested, around 50% of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic. So, if India only tests symptomatic cases, it's a given that community spread has already happened. All it would've taken is one or a few people to spread.Funny thing is, in many places they're not even testing the family members of Tablighi Jammat attendees.

 According to ICMR our current testing strategy is: 

* All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days:

* All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

* All symptomatic health care workers.

* All hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath).

* Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.

It‚Äôs crystal clear that we‚Äôve a very restrictive testing criteria that only tests NRIs, foreigners and people who‚Äôre in direct with these people, including medical staffs. We are completely masking the community transmission of corona virus, since people who were directly in contact with those people might have come in contact with hundreds of other people. 

An example of this would be recent Nizamuddin Dargah and Shradhdha ceremony incidents where government only quarantined only those people who were directly involved in the events but those who attended these event might have further spread the virus to several other people, Several thousands or way more to be specific. 

One of the attendee of Jamat was a grocery shopkeeper in my uncle‚Äôs town, he was recently taken into custody. So, he alone might have come in contact with thousands of people before he was taken into custody. 

Also, last week 2 people died from corona virus in Dharavi slum, where millions of people are jam-packed in a tiny area, they use the same water-taps and toilets, apparently the government only tested 70 people in that slum and 15 tested positive. Which is no-where near the actual numbers, those 15 people might have come in contact with several hundreds or thousands of people in their own slum. 

If this goes on, I believe we‚Äôll completely ignore the community transmission and the fact that ‚Äúasymptomatic carries‚Äù of corona virus are the biggest cause of cases increasing exponentially in developed countries. 

I don‚Äôt think, Kerala flattening the curve is something to be happy about (yet). Since, they‚Äôve started rapid testings to check community transmission I believe that might give us a clearer picture of the situation.

Edit: yesterday, they‚Äôve added the criteria of testing symptomatic people, to check community transmission. Hope, it brings a more accurate statistics of infected cases. 

hotspots/cluster (as   per   MoHFW) and in large migration gatherings/evacuees centres

83,sudden_dust,"Skeletons are coming out of closet of this government.It's still too early to talk about these. We don't have the right numbers. What if some factor meant a large population of Gujarat got infected and we don't know about it due to overall low testing in India. Let's wait for mass antibody tests to be done before making some conclusions.I'm not going to argue with numbers that articles is presenting and the fact that Gujarat indeed is mediocre when it comes to healthcare. Government spends little money for public healthcare. 

The reason why mortality is high is because there's not enough testing being done. Initially the samples were being sent to Pune, then ICMR approved BJMC lab to test samples. And as of now around 10 labs (government+ private) are approved. Similar numbers of lab are approved in Mumbai alone. 

But in this case, in my opinion, Gujarat government did acted better than I expected. I work in the civil hospital Ahmedabad,  the 1200 bed hospital reserved for coronavirus treatment is a 5 min walk from the my hospital complex.

Government decided to reserve 1200 bed hospital for covid19 early in the March, then they also added 1700 bed (SVP hospital) and  sola civil hospital. And I'm talking about Ahmedabad only, I don't know exact number of beds available in Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Bhavnagar.

Ventilators available initially in the entire state were around 2700, the 1000 additional ventilators that article is talking about is a prototype made by a Rajkot based company. Even before this prototype was approved, Jayanti Ravi(health secratary) mentioned in a TV interview that order for ventilators was already placed.

And the 9000 health workers that are being trained for ventilator support are MOs, nurses, physiotherapists and dentists. It doesn't mean that right now there's shortage of staff skilled to operate ventilators. 

Vijay Rupani is not  the brightest bulb, but he's certainly not an egotist like modi-shah. The person who is handling everything is Dr.Jayanti Ravi, and she's inteligent. I don't have any complaints about her handling of the situation.

Also if ur friends had babies, u can reuse their baby clothes too . Since babies grow fast, the initial clothes which they wear in first few months dont get used much and can be reused by other babies after careful washing.

117,pentacle555,"Back in the days of DD, many people in Northern India loved Pakistani soaps, they were far better written with much more nuanced characters.

Not sure when Indian viewership ebbed away, but I suspect satellite TV and a subsequent ban on Pakistani channels had something to do with it. Still, Zee started a channel dedicated to Pakistani soaps as recently as 2014 (until 2016).

While personally I can‚Äôt get into *any* soaps, (even something like *The Affair*), some of my friends really like Pakistani soaps as a refreshing change from Indian TV.My mother used to watch them on Zindagi Channel. The stories were good/great but were so depressing and tragic that my mother got depressed. 

Thankfully that channel closed down due to nationalist propagandaPakistani Shows are really good and they are now what Indian shows used to be back in 90s.

Strong female characters

No ""Dhoom tananananan""

No ""Vamp"" with Industrial makeups

No sleeping in jwellery and saree

Story that people could relate to

No 5 cut from every angle of each family member till the episode ends

Story arc that had an end and was not
 stretched.

And you know whom to blame for this degradation.Dont know about shows but i listen to pakistani music and in contact with few youtubers and Photographers. Dude they're amazing artists.After the abrogation of 370 I was bored to death,  my neighbour got me hooked up on Pakistani serials during lockdown. At first I was reluctant to watch them, then later on I got to know what I am actually missing out. Stories that can relate to real case scenario.

1. Khamoshi

2. Bala 

3. Beti

4. Tabeer

5. Qaid

6. Khuda aur Mohabat (Season 1)

7. Ek Tamana lahasil ke

8. Ranjha ranjha kardi

9. Mera pass tum ho.Not me but my mom watches them. But from what even I have seen those; miles better than these shitty Indian ones. The best part is that their story is usually contained in around 35-40 episodes, maybe less. If u want, after this show u have been watching, my personal recommendation would be 'Ahd-e-wafa'.Watched 'Maat' a long time ago and liked it.I travel a bit (a lot) and use to watch the K-dramas (Korea soaps) in Spanish or the Brazilian Telenovelas in Romanian.  They make as much sense as any of the other soaps. The language was irrelevant.Should check out [Ranjha Ranjha Kardi](https://youtu.be/eEbT-p8KOO8). 

It‚Äôs about a girl, Noori, who comes from a family of garbage pickers. She rejects her status in society and decides to move to the city to move up the social hierarchy, ending up crossing paths with Bhola, the mentally challenged son of an affluent family. The show deals with themes relating to caste, class, gender, and the strained relationship between love and ambition. 

Another good one is [Baaghi](https://youtu.be/1dWTpntjhDk).

It is a biographical show based on the famous, controversial Pakistani figure Qandeel Baloch who was murdered by her brother in the name of honor. The plot revolves around a rebellious girl that is disillusioned be the idea of marriage after seeing her older sister suffer domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, and going through a failed marriage herself. She decides to leave her village and head to Karachi in hopes of pursuing a modeling career.[deleted]I've watched one pak series called 'Mann ke Moti' and it was really good. I'd recommend you to look at 2-3 episodes and then judge it.I strongly recommend Udaari. It's about child sexual abuse. Pretty spot on drama, one of my favourite. 
Other than that I have watched zindagi Gulzar hai, Humsafar, Maat, Baaghi.

Maat and Baaghi are good. I loved Zindagi Gulzar hai when I watched it the first time, second time watch made me feel that the story line is somewhat hypocritical and sexist. I don't like Humsafar, cheesy for my liking.

I am the person who always watched shows like House MD / Game of Thrones / Westworld ...and kind of ridiculed Indian shows (still do) but I didn't dislike Qurban. It was different from what I have been watching in general. I found few dialogues very powerful, deep and meaningful in the show. Maybe they turned more beautiful because of the heavy Urdu words.

Translation : 

&#x200B;

The streets were completely deserted.

Was unaware of my innocence.

The calamity that came

From the huts to the havelis were disturbed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All were imprisoned in their nests,

The flight of the bird was free.

Everyone cares about their loved ones,

Here my mother was upset with my hunger

Was a father,

Part of which was more sin than virtue.

Drunk of the morning item,

Pete was at night in the myth of Pete manhood.

&#x200B;

More than death, she was afraid of her God,

Perhaps that's why she used to stay at work all day.

Now sobs were also slow due to beating of weeks,

My mother was in a prison with a sinner. 

&#x200B;

Ration at home was also less,

More than an empty stomach, conditions were lost.

Don't know who was guilty of this plight,

To my ignorance, the government was the soldier of the street.  


&#x200B;

Days were passing like months,

Was waiting for help, sorry for the poor.

Now guess what, what to tell, was government business,

The months have gone by.  


Then some angels came every day,

Seemed to have come in search of a poor.

Four cameras were also brought with half a kilo of potatoes,

Did not know that they had come to give something, or had come to buy self-respect.  


It was heard again and again that the poor thing is poor,

Not everyone will be able to give it to those who are close.

Someone's eye on me too,

Leave it to the voice, it is a favor, it is a strange addiction. 

Knowing in a prickly heart that I am poor,

&#x200B;

Then there was also a feeling of how close to reality I am

A question also arose in the mind,

palace had come to my hut to erase the lust of their virtue,

Then how am I poor?

137,literallyIllliterlly,"You guys are disgusting. As someone who is a victim of Pure OCD and has gone through what OP has, fuck you to all of you. OP seek a psychologist and just remember your intrusive thoughts don't represent you. Thoughts come and go. Try not to engage with themYou NEED to see a psychologist! Please please please do it as early as possible.Go to a psychologist.Others have already given excellent advice so I won't repeat that.

Since you like anime, watch some lighthearted, comedy shows like Gintama(will keep you occupied and laughing for a long time), Daily Lives of High School Boys, Nichijou, School Rumble, Konosuba, etc. instead of the dark stuff like Hellgirl, Deathnote, etc.OP. Med student here so take it with a grain of salt

Everything you mentioned really points me towards psycosis of some sort ,your clearly having  hallucinations.

Also you have delusions of guilty : aka you think your a criminal 

Delusions of reference : your seeing signs 

But clam down , op it's gonna be alright,  go see a psychiatrist as soon as ya can he'll probably give you some medications.Are there any mods in here? People commenting triggering stuff to a person that needs medical help must be banned. This is inhumane.Hey man, please read the book Brain Lock by Jeffrey M Shawatz. It's available on libgen. You're suffering from Pure OCD, and the book has the best steps you can follow that will alleviate you combating your thoughts. 


Getting a hobby is also extremely important. 
I've been through this, keep at it for 4-5 months, you'll be better.Please see a psychologist/psychiatrist **ASAP**. This could be a variety of things, but if it's the prodrome of schizophrenia, which it might well be (given your symptoms, and the fact that this seems precipitated by the lack of social contact), then getting treated earlier can [potentially make a massive difference in outcomes for the rest of your life](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/20/treat-the-prodrome/).

Also, start contacting people and talking to them. Not necessarily about your intrusive thoughts or whatever, unless you feel comfortable talking to them about this stuff, but just talking and socialising, over the phone or video chat if possible. This may help significantly.

No matter what, though, don't delay getting professional help, **please**; this is important.OP here's a book for you, I hope it would help. 

Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts : a CBT-Based Guide to Getting Over Frightening, Obsessive, or Disturbing Thoughts


https://b-ok.cc/book/3702816/879a54Mate im no doctor/scientist or anything. But are you sleeping alright? Like a smooth 7-8 hours of sleep every night?Hey OP. I am not diagnosing, but these intrusive thoughts are very common with OCD. I suggest you go to a therapist or psychiatrist to work through this

  


Intrusive thoughts are scary and they will often make you feel like you're a terrible person which inturn will increase your paranoia and anxiety. And remember, Your intrusive thoughts don't define who you areSo many horrible comments. This country's mental health awareness is pathetic.

Sweety, you're going to be all right. You're not alone. I have personally dealt with severe OCD and intrusive thoughts myself and I understand what you're going through

Right now, it seems like you're having something similar to a panic attack. It WILL end and you'll be fine again. I need you to recognise that. What you're going through us temporary.

There are breathing techniques that will help you in this moment. Focus on deep, slow breaths. Keep listening to your heartbeat. Keep reminding yourself that it will pass.

If you have the number of a local psychologist, give them a call. Else, get it from Practo. They will talk you through it. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with it. You do not have to be ashamed.

There are also discord groups where you can talk to people who go through similar things. You can DM whenever you like.

You have to keep reminding yourself that you're not alone, that your panic and intrusive thoughts will pass and everything will get better. Because that's the truth. Once you're done with the breathing exercises, take a long bath or get some rest. I love you and stay safe.[deleted]If you are serious try a different subreddit.Create a new account and call it a dayStop watching anime. Watch comedies. Talk to your mom.

I don't know if it's allowed to post this here but I don't know what to do ....I'm scared shitless right now. 

Basically I'm having a crisis .... 

I'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... Scary things .....

It started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I'm not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

That escalated to ""maybe I am actually a criminal"" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I'm an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I'm a criminal... I'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

Now the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

And that I'd lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I'm getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary 

Especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

Most of my friends are online and I'm in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven't contacted them ..... And I've been scared shitless ...... 

Many of the other things I'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as ""warnings"" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It's so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

I even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... 

Because of which I'm unable to let my guard down ....

And it's really scaring me ......

Even if most relegions might not have hell ... I'm scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It's really scary and ruining my health

I'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",Scared..,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxvqao/scared/

Literally a quote from his speech. People hear what they want to hear.

Source : https://news.abplive.com/videos/news/india-pm-modi-appeals-religious-leaders-to-help-in-fight-against-coronavirus-1187747#"" Pta hai na aap sabko...""So we need permission from PM to maintain communal harmony ? It's high time we stop blaming him for our own insecurities and problems. Sad that public is only aggravating this communal problem and strengthening his hold in midst of defying him.Might as well ask him to resign. If there's no hindu muslim fight, he has no reason to exist.Not that I am on his side, but he did mention something on those lines. He did.Kapol Kalpana1. He's been saying this only! It's called reading between the lines. When did he say go and slit the throats. He's been saying to acknowledge the gratitude towards others, and as no body is able to get out, then at least get out and gather in your respective balconies, and do small cheerful act. At least by seeing all others too in their respective balconies, it gives a sense of moral support to each one of us. It's like trapped into a void with nothing to do, and then even the simplest sight of humans around can be small little joy givers. That's the simplest of how these speeches can be decoded, psychologically. ""ghar me pade pade, bahaari duniya se naata toot chuka hai, kabhi kabaar ek dusre ko balcony me taliya bajate hi dekh lene se man ko thoda achha hi lag jata hai. aur chutiyo ki tarah taali bajane toh bola nhi hai, atleast yahi soch ke baja lo ki jo apni marwa rhe hai bichare, unko thoda thank you ya salam"". Lauda har baat me fuddu point dhund ke ""sarkaar"" ki gand marne ki koi zaroorat nhi hai!  

2. Government has no 9-5 job of inculcating moral values, humanitarian values and sense of gratitude & belonging into people. It's the job of your parents see your upbringing. Even if government says hindus go and slit muslims, aren't you a human being? Haven't you got the basic sense of understanding what's called a life? Haven't you been taught from your parents that we all come from same blood and flesh? And we are all mortals? Ab kya gandhi ya modi sarkar pehle banaye, fir tumhe sikhae ki jeevan me kya krna chahiye ya kya nahi? Aur jab sarkar tumhe batayegi ki jeevan me kya krna kya nahi karna, fir hi jake hum kuch karengey. Nahi toh nahi. Toh bhai sarkar nahi, tum chutiya ho, aur tumhari parvarish me kami hai. Chahe gandhi baithey, tharoor kal ko baithe ya modi ya shah, har baar, har fuudu baat par ""sarkaar"" ko bich me lana, aur bolna, ki sarkar bataegi toh karenge ji .. nahi toh nhi. Aur sarkar nhi bataegi, to sarkar chutiya. Aur sarkar ne kuch bataya, toh usme galti nikal kr bolo, sarkar gandu. Tumhari samajh, education aur moral values ghaass charne gai hai?  

3. Khud socho aur khud karo jo theek lagta hai. Lastly, If I make you a Shepard, and give you 100 goats and ask you to take them to grazing, you'll go well, make sure they are fed well, and you'll bring them back safe. After some time I give you 1000 goats, and ask to fed them by taking them to graze. But 500 of them love dried grass, 500 love wet. As a shepard, you'll still try to make sure each one happy by providing different types of grass as per their need. But then after some time I give you 1 lac goats, and ask to make sure each one's need is satisfied, then you'll run away. You just cant handle the fucking quantity. India is that group of goats now. 1.4 billion. The bloody population with each having their own demands. And then blaming one man, or government, is absolute stupidity. We ourselves are to blame, for what we've made this nation into.

the world denounces all religions and starts using its brain to perceive reality accurately.

when humanity wakes up to the fact that all of us share 99.99% of our DNA make-up and billions of years of evolutionary history with common ancestors.

when humans stop erecting fences around arbitrary territories claiming it to be their own. When political maps will have fewer boundaries.

when humans stop manufacturing weapons of mass destruction which endanger not just our existence, but that of most multi-cellular life forms on our planet.

So I was in fourth standard and for a typical guy of that age I was gifted a cycle for my birthday.

So excited as I was I rushed downstairs to go for a spin in the cycle.

The area I live in is cut up into small block square I'm shape road running through it.

 So I start peddalling the cycle.

Note that I had no prior experience in cycling..

So I start peddalling and get a taste for speed. With confidence in heart and two step wheels for balance I drifted through the first corner.

The headrush made me pedal faster and the second and third corner I was almost leaning into the curve F1 style.

I knew that at the Fourth corner I'll have to exit the loop to go back to my house, so i start hitting the brakes. Only then did I realise that brakes are not a magic stop sign that completely suspend all motion. I couldnt control the speed, panicked and ended up directing the front wheel into the Gutter.

I slipped from my seat and and hit the steering rod balls first.
The pain was so shocking that I couldn't contemplate what happened, sat down on the street for 10 minutes, went home and slept on the sofa.

That damn cycle would later almost kill me..

That's for another time..Alright I'm off to bed, today I have to sleep on my side cause can't look at ceilingMai bachpan me books churata tha library se. Meri family kaafi move karti thi toh me ek jagah itna raha bhi nahi ki kisiko mujhpe shak ho. Pehli baar bas alas ki wajah se churaya tha. Move karne se pehle maa ne bola tha book wapas karne ko toh maine bag me chupa li thi. Us library me waise bhi koi jata bhi nahi tha toh guilt bhi nahi hua.

Phir toh maine bohot books churaye hai. Pehle apne liye phir dosto ke liye bhi. Ek dost ke liye Asterisk and Obelix comics churata tha, pehli gf ke liye 50 shades series mari thi, aur ek aur dost ke liye ek dozen self help books churayi hongi.

Sabse daring chori ki thi jab ek librarian ko shak ho chuka tha ki books gayab ho rahi hai. Usko mujhpe shak nahi tha kyunki hum dost the aur mai waise bhi din bhar library me hi rehta tha. Churake bhi padhunga kab. Us time library me naya stock aaya tha aur mai bhi phir move kar raha tha. Toh maine dus barah books ikethe kie aur window ke saamne chhod di. Phir bahar gaya aur ek mala windows pe chadke books nikali. Still proud of that one.

Toh baat december ki hai jab ham teen  dost bike ride ke liye gujarat gaye the delhi se. Do bike thi aur dono hi KTM duke 200. Ek main chala rha tha aur mere piche 'P' betha tha. Doosri bike 'D' chala rha tha.

Hum log uss din Rann of kutch cross kar ke aa rahe the aur Dholaravira ja rhe the. 

Dholavira is a place which during rainy season becomes an island. So only one road connects it to the rest of Gujarat. And the road goes straight for about 5 kms with nothing on both sides, just dry sand.

Toh sunset hone waala tha aur hume apne tent pitch karne ke liye jagah bhi dhundni thi andhera hone se pehle kyunki andhera hone ke baad kafi problem hoti hai tent setup karne mein.

Hum uss road pe enter karne hi waale the aur sunet ho rha tha (and by god, aaj tak usse sundar sunset nahi dekha,  kabhi photo share karunga), tabhi hume ek deserted building dikhti hai road se thoda 100 meters hatke.

It turned out to be a 2 storey Forest department watch tower. Aas pas mein sabse uchi jagah woh hi thi bhot dur tak. Toh naturally view bahut acha aa rha tha. So we decide to stay there for the night.

And Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king. The English sneered at how rough we are and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went. 

Til one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord. Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed as happens and Mr. Allen found he needed the privy. He was grateful to be directed thence. Relieved, you might say. Mr. Allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of George Washington. Ethan Allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room. 

His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait. And finally his lordship couldn't resist and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it - the picture of Washington - he had. Well what did he think of its placement? Did it seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen? And Mr. Allen said it did. 

The host was astounded. (mocking British accent) ""Appropriate? George Washington's likeness in a water closet?"" ""Yes,"" said Mr. Allen, ""where it will do good service. The whole world knows nothing will make an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington.""

Now I've heard that during the 2008 crash many rich folks who had lots of extra cash bought the cheap stocks,properties etc and sold them a year or two later at a much higher price when things started getting better again.

Can I do something similar,albeit on a small scale?

I'm going to be in college in a few months,I'm still 17.
Now I have a genuine interest in all the ""grown up"" stuff like taxes,stock markets,etc.

I've read that using a Credit Card responsibly and paying it back on time boosts one's credit score,which in turn helps getting loans easier and at a lower interest rate.

So,Since I'll be in college,my expenses would be around 3000 a month on an average. And I'm thinking that maybe I should purchase a big chunk of it with a credit card and pay it back. Now 4-5 years of timely payments and responsible use would surely help me in the future,right?

So should I get a credit card? If yes,how many (I've heard the more,the better). My dad will pay me the money I need,its not like I'll have to work. I'd really appreciate any advice. :)Loser # 4 is here*koi hai*I fear that this recession will hit our industries and startups beyond redemption.

Worst questioning govt may get you booked under or trolled by bhakts or both.You cannot blame Government for behaviour of people. If those idiots want to stock equipments and create a shortage to increase price they will face consequences sooner or later. And not just them some people are buying these things in bulk for household purposes which is absolutely unnecessary people staying at home don't need mask but some of them don't want to listen.And sending stuff to Serbia was necessary that is a way of maintaining relations

And the production of PPE's has been ramped up let's just hope that these equipments reach doctors soon 

Also thanks to people like your parents that our nation is able to fight this virus.Honestly this is the reality not just in India but around the world. There are many individuals in this world that are inherently of this sort and sorry to say but you cannot expect the government to take care of every single shitbag that is involved in this.

This is a pandemic and not something that any country plans for beforehand. Yes the medical staff is on the forefront of this and has to bear the brunt of the pandemic, to which I have the utmost respect for them but thus is the world we live in and have to live through. If you expect the government to do everything right by you then I‚Äôm sorry to say but you‚Äôre naivety is just to big to ignore.

Maybe the government might reimburse or maybe it won‚Äôt but at this time I do not think that takes priority over containing this virus.

The people that are exhibiting such stupidity are to solely held responsible for their actions. We have seen this with everything where if the government takes action against such stupidity, it almost always backfires. This is the reality and I‚Äôm in no way defending the current government but we cannot foolishly just blame an entity for everything that we deem wrong in the country.Hi I have a few points for this and I will edit this comment as I add them.

The thali bajao was to show appreciation for doctors, however do you think people did it because of that. For them it was just another party or entertainment, to them doctors meant jack shit. Others did it because they thought that it would kill Corona. The very next day a doctor is Surat was threatened by her neighbour, what the hell was the neighbors problem I don't know, if he didn't want to meet her he could have just stayed in his home. 

You have also mentioned that doctors are a hated community in india, that is not so, Indians hate everybody, today they are doctors and tomorrow it may be someone else, look at Kejriwal, he built hospitals and mohala clinics in Delhi, the same hospitals and clinics that will are coming useful now, imagine our position if we did not have them and government hospitals had poor facilities, still the centre tried everything in their power that mohala clinics and hospitals did not get built. People hated Kejriwal for this and mocked him to no end, especially the middle class, who are the people now assaulting doctors. So in conclusion Indians hate everyone. To be honest I would be glad if a doctor was a neighbor during such times, in case of any emergency I would get priority. Also a doctor would never infect his family.

Coming to the judiciary, yes these people don't know how things work, they may know but may not care, most of these judges, but not all, consider themselves to be high and mighty and they run over the common man without a second thought, especially if their paymasters like Adani and Ambani command them to. Just look at this example below.

This virus outbreak is causing a lot of problems for all hospitals. People who don't really require it are hoarding masks and other medicines. This has caused a grave problem as protective masks which you could buy for Rs.2.5 6 months ago are now being sold for ten times their price. This is morally wrong, unethical but sadly it is not illegal in [India](https://indiacorplaw.in/2020/03/price-gouging-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-an-analysis-of-the-regulatory-strategies.html) . This affects the people in the medical field the most as they are the ones who depend on these products the most.

All doctors are risking their lives by treating patients during this pandemic and they get screwed by the public. One day everyone was clapping which was originally planned as a gesture of appreciation for doctors and nurses. The next day we get news about [stone pelting](https://english.jagran.com/india/coronavirus-outbreak-health-officials-attacked-in-indore-during-covid19-patient-tracking-two-injured-watch-10010285) which had happened on doctors .Majority of the people of these country always had a certain hatred for doctors and the current situation would only intensify their hate towards them.

Most medical shops seemed to have closed down but in reality they have hijacked the cost of all the medications to 10-20 times their original price and are selling these essential supplies secretly. This is all really messed up that some people are trying (and succeeding) to profit  off of this.

When the doctors ask the government for help I think the government laughs at them. When there is an acute shortage of PPE, [the government has exported them to Serbia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/even-as-docs-use-raincoats-india-exports-suits-to-serbia/articleshow/74957518.cms). Our dear and beloved PM has done nothing except tell everybody to clap and light some freaking candles. Also the Supreme Court decided that all private facilities capable of doing so must [test suspected carriers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-orders-free-coronavirus-testing-at-private-labs-1664802-2020-04-08) of the coronavirus free of charge. I don't think once this disease is contained that the government has the slightest intention of reimbursing the labs. Currently, the labs are supposed to test the patients for free and incur the loss as they themselves have to purchase the testing kits. I don't think these people who decided this understand how business/economy works.

I really hope something is done about ALL the things I have talked about. I honestly hope that the problems highlighted above are dealt with. Things are going to get worse before they get better. The lockdown will have to be extended. Please remember what the people who are responsible for treating the patients and who have to expose themselves are going through.",This disease is showing us who the real parasites are in this country,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxrbg9/this_disease_is_showing_us_who_the_real_parasites/

Don't listen to people giving you advice here as they are not qualified and will give general life advice that won't change anything.What made you like this? Were you beaten/bullied as a child?No man is an island. You cannot possibly live all alone your entire life. You can't cut off emotional parts of you like that. 

If you see women as sex machines, what do you see men as?No friends = everyone is a friend.

Most people are lonely within their circle of family and friends & awkward with strangers. You are not an exception, just a bit too self aware.

If you feel you are loosing out on something, nobody can talk you out of it: so
1) buy some company; gym, yoga class, vipassana, training course etc. do something every two months.
2) make a list of loners and bachelors in history to    read their bio, when you want to 
3) make a trip to a natural space; river, mountain, forest, sea every quarter
4) make arrangements to live in a commune when  you are old and need assistance 
5) don‚Äôt compromise, just to taste what you think is normal; you‚Äôll spoil peace

Enjoy the 90% time; that‚Äôs more than anyone has, or care to agree.I really don't think you're as unlikeable as you think. It's probably just an issue of low self esteem mixed in with anxiety. 


If you have anger issues, do consult a professional. Man is a social animal, everyone has the same traits. Perhaps your upbringing didn't allow you to develop the best traits, but that's something that can be rectified. 


You cannot under any circumstances strengthen your mind to stave off sexual desires or the desire to socialize. Prospering and propagating one's species is a basic biological impulse. Perhaps you can start by seeing yourself in a better light, and treating yourself better. 


As for a girlfriend, don't worry. The better the person becomes, you'll soon start to see girls coming to you on their own. 


If you want a reading list, I'd say the book ""4 pillars of self esteem"" and ""Models - Mark Manson"" are good start.Seek a counsellor.[deleted]Eh OP , please I am deeply curious about you. I have never seen any person depict themselves this way. 


1) why do you and your mother agrees that you are a danger to people around you? 


2) Please elaborate on the sex machine thing. If you view women as sex machine , then you want a girlfriend just to have sex with? Marry just to have sex with ? But if you only want sex, you don't necessarily have to get into a relationship? 


Also the 10% of the time that you are craving human interaction only makes you human, because you are human na. Unless you are an aghori sadhu , but even they do social activities sometimes. But I think if you want 100% shun of society then monk or sadhu life is the way to go.it's just a phase, everything will be ok. you are too smart for your own good. just hold on and meanwhile don't hurt anyone, including yourself. or you are headline boy! don't let an unwanted penis in your rectum in a jail cell explain you good from bad.dude start /r/nofap do it and your sexual tendencies will be almost curbed  . it will also give a certain sense of accomplishment . Start doing exercise that you like , I started hiking and doing shadow boxing , it was made easier with music...‚Ä¶. I have tried many things but recently I have come to realise that there is a certain pleasure in abstaining from  your desires , giving up things and listening to the small voice inside of you , to do what you need to do not what you want increases your self esteem drastically , This lockdown could be hell for many but somehow if you use this time correctly maybe you could work on yourself not your desires ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you are only one who can push yourself  no one can move your ass for you , and understand this that even if you clean up all your mess you haven't won yet you only get a starting point..... you will fail many times , unable to even start and when yo do you will simply stop in a short interval and when you fail , count till 15 , throw away all your ego and stand up and get back to work again with a smile ‚Ä¶.. if you want you can dm me",1586466700.0,fy0s1a,AskIndia,20,/r/india/comments/fy0s1a/how_do_i_strengthen_my_mind/,8,"I literally have no friends because I'm straight up unlikable and repulsive.

People avoid me and I avoid people. 


Issue is, it's kinda hard to be alone all the time. But I also don't want to change because frankly, people never change. 

I am also a danger to people around me so even my mom agrees to an extent that it might be good that no girls even like looking at me much less like me. So, despite her lifelong wish of seeing me married someday, some part of her doesn't want to get me married. 

Plus even if I did get married I don't want kids. And since this is India and not some western country, almost zero women would want a childfree life.


Anyway, tldr is that It's probably better for me and people around me that I spend my life alone, but at times I just can't take the fact that I don't have a girlfriend or even friends to talk to.

So how do I strengthen my mind so that I don't feel lonely or bad about any physical needs and stuffs. I just want to shut off the world and my own sexual desires completely so that my mind can be freed a bit.

I basically want to make an app where people can seek free counselling / talk to someone . 

The app just connects people who want to talk/ vent their heart out with people who want to listen and allows them to chat over text. No video, audio , image sharing , emoji bs. 

You must be like why would anybody want to listen because many people  are bored with all forms of social media and want to have a real connection. 

Why would a person talk because sometimes somethings is bothering them and they do not have a proper outlet / person to talk especially who doesn't judge them or thinks they are crazy.

Truth be told I did make such a app in the past with my own hands and it sucked bad. I had a lot of connection issues, privacy issues , security holes, trolling and lack of beta testers and got my hands burned. 

You can see /r/247buddy to see how bad it was.

This time  I want to fund this app and seek app developers who believe in this cause. 

Right now as per my research there aren't proper apps out there, people think suicide hotline  is the only option. 

You may ask I should reach out to Deepika Padukone and her ngo but I feel they have done a poor job in promoting what they do infact they haven't done much.  And their hotline isn't that amazing.

In my app the listeners will have to register and have to go through a basic vetting process. The vetting process will be in adherence to the guidelines set by our counsellors . I am trying to reach out counsellors for this.

Note this app will be free to use and on top of that I don't expect to make a single dime out of it. Yes It has to be non profit as I know my audience they cannot  afford to talk to counsellors.


So based on what I said I hope the app developers who contact me aren't expecting too much money from this. I don't mind paying for your coffee/pizza and internet bills nothing more than that.

My grandmother was asking the god why he is doing this (current pandemic). He has only created us and if he is going to make us suffer with this pandemic, then why he created us.

This make my opinion strong that god has not created us, we have created him to blame for our failures/success/sorrow and everything else which we can't control.Because it is hard for a lot of people to accept that everything is just randomness, they have zero control on outside circumstances, and life has no universal meaning, just the individual meaning you get from it. They need to hold onto the fact that someone/something is in the driver's seat of this giant rock hurtling through space. It can be a comfort, and there's nothing wrong with it.

Until, of course, you start using it to control other people's thoughts, rights and actions.Believing in god gives people hope.

And with hope, people achieve things that they never would have thought they could.

Hope is a strong feeling.

Just thinking that ""everything is going to be alright"" and ""this too shall pass"" gives you the strength to tackle obstacles.Fear. During my childhood and early teenage I was a devout beliver because I was afraid of poor results, ghosts, death of a near or dear one, losing face among friends etc.Its about hope some people believe in it, its their explanation of how the world came to be, if you take it from them they will go into an existential dread.

Notice the difference between people who commit suicide religious people are less likely to end their lives whereas the others are higher.

Religion is about hope. Its a great practice but nowadays its like mine is better than yours kill each other all that bad shit.

Religion is also about discipline, remember when you were a kid your parents used to scare you about ghosts and shit just so you eat or go to sleep or keep quiet, religion is kinda like that.

Maybe its exaggerated tales of kings and queens and other people back in ancient times and over time it transformed into what it is now.

Who knows? Maybe once we die we might know the truth. If there is a heaven/hell of course.Parents enforce it on the next generation and so onIf you ask me directly and you're someone who's rational and open minded, id say I don't believe in God.

If not, I'll just throw it out there saying I somewhat believe it and avoid all the hassle of majority of the society. I've been to religious events purely out of curiosity, and my brain just couldn't accept anything they were preaching, almost purely brainwashing for a brief sense of happiness and safety. I do have friends whose faith is strong as steel, and I won't judge them, they are living their lives without bothering others.

The more I read about science the more I believe in Him. I truly feel like I am nothing without him, and yes I cannot prove it because that is something I feel about God, which is love. I don't worship idols or images though.I read a quote that just explains all these things in short. I don't know the exact quote but it goes like

> It's easier to fool someone than to explain him that he has been fooled.

Sums it all up.I-ve observed that mostly elders are more into gods, the mighty plan and astrology. I think because they place their hopes on some being watching over them every other positive coincidental thing that happened to them  reinforces their belief in the idea of gods/astrology. And they seldom question urban myths. I hate it when they just credit the gods for every little thing that goes right in their life. Also society plays a part in all this too. People want to be accepted too. Hence they dont oppose or think for themselves too.A lot of people I know say that believing in god gives them a sense of hope ..I have been thinking about this recently. If you look at every world religion and their origin stories, it seems like they were written by an idiot. A woman gets pregnant without having sex, pair of animals in a ship, curses from mahabharata, flying monkeys, death to anyone who does not believe in this religion etc. Take a few moments and look into all these stories with logic and you will be shocked at how little thinking went into these stories by the writers....sala kuch ve likh doTo create a neutral common control mechanism of comparison of 'religious' values so as to control people that cant be controlled by virtue of their actual skills,talents and/or brains. Religion gives dumb people an area to shine where they dont have to prove their worth on an intrinsic basis and thus can accumulate importance enough to control people with actual intrinsic value through social pressure or threat of being made an outsider.

That is the purpose of religion. Its value is personal and never has to be divulged between people for any mandatory reason.God is Time, it is NOT an abstract entity!

Then why do you believe in him? I came out with 3 reasons for it.

1. Age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

So, we are passed on from Generations the books like Gita, Bible, and Quran and many others. And people telling it from so long. The story of Ram and Krishna passed on through ages. It‚Äôs true or not, it does not matter. It was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. It‚Äôs worth considering. And no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. Exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

So, there are times people experience, so-called God bliss. By that, I mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. And after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

I think this happens with most of the people around. And that is how I think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. It‚Äôs like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

Its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. It is the force of probability.

And yeah, you may think it doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone, its probability, It happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in God. It‚Äôs because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. So, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some God. Maybe there is‚Ä¶

3. You cannot prove something, that doesn‚Äôt exist:

So, a great philosopher. I don‚Äôt remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. You can say yes, it exists. Why?

Because if God exists, you are right. And if he doesn‚Äôt exist, then you can never prove something that doesn‚Äôt exist. Like if I say, I am seeing a God, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. You will say it does not. But in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. You cannot prove negativity. You cannot prove things that don‚Äôt exist. You can only prove things that exist.",Why do we believe in God?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxuzbv/why_do_we_believe_in_god/

The only reason this stupidity is allowed is because dumbasses are always in majority.The Jamaat incident was highlighted because most of the participants got tested positive. Also, attacks on health workers and policemen didn't help either. Yeah, there are a lot of gatherings of Hindus, Christians, and Sikhs that have been reported but until they get tested positive, you won't see them in media.1. Holla mohalla event in anandpur sahib (event happened before lockdown though. This is a Sikh event.)
2. Holi celebrations (before lockdown)
3. Shradh event in MP (event held on personal capacity)Two things:

1. The gatherings had almost no international visitor

2. No one has tested positive for coronavirus after attending these events.'Fidato @tequieremos'

Isn't that guy from pro-paksitan IT-Cell. 

Also, why you giving it a communal color. Just because someone else is doing it doesn't mean we should do it too.I think all religions are senseless and will always brainwash gullible people. No religion deserve any respect according to me.

Now for people blaming all muslims for jamaat incident, you should understand that it is because of the deep seated hatred against muslims in people's mind. The people who are blaming muslims now weren't loving them before this incident anyway, although this might have made the situation worse. Your whataboutism on hindu festivals and hindu gatherings isnt gonna help people change their mind rather make the situation worse. People like these are in every religion and if they can really think with logic we wouldn't be seeing these religious gatherings or all the bad things happening in name of religion.Did those gatherings have international visitors? The ones that did test positive, did they chase health workers and hurled them with stones and sticks? Did they spit on them deliberately?

If there are idiots in temples, then expose them for what they are, but at least get the facts right while trying to defend the Tablighi. All these events are prior to the Tablighi, **and prior to any lockdown**. Secondly, how many involved foreigners coming here, and hiding when the problem aggravated. Even today, many people who went to the Tablighi congregation are in hiding. Can this be said for the above tweets? 

There was an earlier tweet by a person defending the Markaz gathering. He deleted his account after many people pointed out the lies in his post. I quote from my post 

> You say that these people were not hiding. Over 400 people have been put in hospitals because they showed symptoms of the virus. Over 400 people showing symptoms of a serious illness, and they do not even think of going to a doctor, and yet you want us to believe that they were not hiding.

> Also, I searched for a news article of last week, but failed. The article said that the authorities were trying to find the source of infection for the Andaman patients, as they had only travelled to Delhi, and had no contact with any foreigners. If they were not trying to hide anything, why did they conceal the fact as to where they had gone, and why did they conceal their contact with the foreigners.

There is a massive failure on part of the Home Ministry in allowing a gathering of foreigners from countries that had high coronavirus risk, at a high risk time. But, it is the behaviour of the Tablighi idiots after the incident that distinguishes them from idiots of other religions. Their decision to remain concealed in Nizamuddin after so many of them developed symptoms of the disease, their attempts to hide themselves, their refusal to come out even after announcements are being made at many places shows that they cannot be defended.People have no common sense ! The jamaat people the Ram navami people the protest rally people all ignoring saftey instructions !!You're the one who is the same as those people hating talbighi incident. You're no differentThe point is not that there were large Hindu gatherings. The point is that Covid didn't spread through those gatherings. People will have treated these gatherings the same way it happened with Tablighi gatherings. It was all about a matter of chance. I mean Kanika Kapoor didn't infect a single person preset at her parties, the lady who went to satsang with 1500 people didn't infect anyone but Tablighi people did.> I am a agnostic. I respect ALL religions and I believe they all have good and pure intentions at their core. 

... that makes you secular, not agnostic. üòíI don't think all religions have pure intentions at the core. Some are dangerous, some are stupid, some are super stupid and some are oknot having this many international visitors with virus in other religious gatherings was I think the reason behind other gatherings not getting a spotlight.Canada is [initiating a large-scale study](https://blood.ca/en/about-us/media/newsroom/covid-19-convalescent-plasma-for-patients)of using the plasma from recovered patients to see if it is works. 

If it does, and I hope it does, it'll mean that the Tablighi Jamaat people will become the source of cure for India, since they are well spread out and have been the most tracked :)  Oh, the schadenfreude would be soooo sweet.Is the government not testing these people ?how many temples in Delhi were closed on 13th?Can I also get Christian list? Sikh, Buddhist and Jewish gatherings?For everyone holding the jamati incident to be more condemnable bcoz it had more cases as opposed to other religious gatherings which had no case.....Let me cite you an analogy

So some migrants in bihar have killed a native for reporting the officials that these migrants had sneaked in.So this got reported and featured on news and got condemned as someone had gotten killed.....But tell me.... is it that the case where instead of just one, multiple whistleblowers would have gotten killed ought to have received more condemnation than the ""single death case"" or ""no death case""......
No coz all the 3 cases deserve the same condemnation bcoz the sheer act of harming or threatening the whistleblower is bad

So a gathering that had no fatalities is as condemnable as gathering with fatalities as both played a stupid game(which is what should be condemned) but only the latter won stupid prizesWoh kahaa gaye jinho ney naarey lagaaye they, ab inko bhi bolo

I welcome criminal proceedings against the organizers of tablighi Jamaat who flouted the law, but please do not hold ALL Muslims responsible for the actions of a select few.

Also i think these religious gatherings are not limited only to a single community

All religious gatherings need to be highlighted by the media, if at least to educate the locals and to put pressure on local governments into taking precautionary measures and containment measure to stop the spread of Corona virus.

EDIT : What happened After the Tablighi Jamaat was criminal .....i.e the maulvi's & some participants not co-operating with Indian authorities

Although there were larger gatherings of Hindu's as well ...i do not think they have (luckily, as yet) spread the virus. Why? because there is no way the virus would not have been detected and linked to some of them cause devotees (60,000) come from across India.

Yogi was and will always be a religious bigot and an idiot. and Yes there were foreigners in some of the gatherings too (ISCON)

However, targeting one community and calling it corona Jihad or whatever is wrong.

/sIs this called shradh jihad now?There are many such religious clusters in India, shradh ceremony, vaishno devi, tablighi jamaat etc. The Jamaat incident is just one of them, you will obviously have a higher proportion of jamaat patients to the total corona patients if you only test them. Did we even consider that the other clusters can also have corona patients. All Jamaat people are being tested irrespective of whether they have symptoms or not, while normal people are tested only under strict guidelines, media houses as usual are busy making this into a communal issue, nobody even mentions the word sampling bias. which is what the jamaat incident is.What is shradh?Im sure modia will cover this with due diligence.Aaj Tak, Zee news, ABP news, India TV and Republic TV aren't covering this, why?But the most reliable sources on this very sub told me that all the idiots spreading the disease were from tablighi jamat...Only Tablighi Jamat‚Äôs Delhi event Is decorated in the TVs as the main cause of spread, hoping Sanghis will enjoy the deaths of the minorities. But what about shradh and many other Hindu ceremonies? What happened to them? Will they be tested?

If not tested, how do you ensure that the deaths caused were not due to COVID19? 

Is Indian administration hiding the real numbers by not testing enough or under reporting, like what US claims China did ?Let's see how the mainstream media covers this.What the heck is wrong with India and the virus? They refuse to stay inside they gather in large groups, assault medical staff and sexually harass female medical staff.IAS officers fucked up Bhopal totally.

Let's do our part in highlighting Godi Media's blatant Islamophobic hypocrisy.  
Let's also not try to turn this into a competition of which community contributed to more covid cases though. 

I feel sorry for both the Jamaat and the people who attended this event.   
Religion really does need to die as it'll kill us before our natural deaths.Considering this event occurred a few days before the lockdown, I'm guessing these people didn't know the severity of the situation. Same as Tablighi people who had already gathered before the announcement of lockdown. Correct me if I'm wrong pls.What I thought the number was more than 1500?No common sense at all !

Your and your family's safety is  your own responsibility ,if you are  invited do not go , avoid crowd as much as you can and also do not organize such events too.

If people want it to stay this way, changes will need to be made. But it‚Äôs clearly not possible to implement US style exhaust catalysts made of platinum and which cost almost as much as a new car in India. What alternatives are there to using expensive exhaust catalysts? 

About a decade ago the US experimented with natural gas trucks. Hundreds of thousands were produced. The experiment failed not because the trucks did not work, but because the corporations which owned them turned down the power to save fuel and this made drivers refuse to drive them. They could not drive safely with such little power on such heavy vehicles. 

The trucks actually worked well when they were not restricted with poorly conceived programming from office workers who had no idea what they were doing. 

These systems are already proven and can be installed on existing trucks. In fact, there are thousands and thousands of them sitting idle on dealer lots in the US right now. If the government or companies wanted to try them out they would not even need to spend anything on development. It‚Äôs already developed. They can simply install existing systems or import cheap US trucks nobody wants. Just remember to use proper programming and drop the corporate nonsense. 

**As an added bonus, adopting these systems would also allow India to use its large natural gas reserves instead of having to import diesel. India imports 82% of diesel.**

First of all, please note that this is a composite shot, meaning the stars and the Moon were shot separately and then blended together for artistic effect.

##Equipment-
Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm lens, a cheap ass tripod, one remote shutter

##Software-
PIPP, Autostakkert, Lightroom, Photoshop

##EXIF-
F/11, 1/800x 600 exposures, ISO 800

##Process-
1)Getting the focus right is the singular biggest challenge while shooting the Moon, so I spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible

2) Took more than 600 exposures of the Moon, and 120 Dark frames

3) Put all these into PIPP, which aligns all the exposures easily and uses the dark frames to reduce some noise

4) Next, the aligned frames are imported to Autostakkert, which stacks all the frames together. It basically takes the average of all the exposures to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the final resulting image

5) Final processing done in Lightroom, then added the star background and blended the two shots together in Photoshop.

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

&#x200B;

[J&K Doctor's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/e1f5q5p6mrr41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=61108bdc3b92f1d06a78a65a45332d2067dca842)

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient. 

&#x200B;

[J&K Teacher's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/ybr8hgv8mrr41.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=506f18b04aa10488edac202d812b8740ff515a54)

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF‚Äôs Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today‚Äôs hearing which happened via video conferencing.

238,Anony_789,"You have ascended. Materialistic possessions mean nothing to you anymore. Honestly, if all that is not hurting you why even bother changing. Although I think an AC would improve your qol a lot especially if you are situated in north Indian parts that are infamous for harsh summers. A good night's sleep is worth it and you and your family deserve it. Your father earned it so get that at least. As for iphone 11, i know morons who are practically drowning in debt because they keep buying shit they can't afford. I'm kinda like your father minus the fuck you money that you guys got. If I had more money than i do maybe I'd have got myself a dog. Or a cat. Or both. Other than that I can't think of anything else. Being content with everything around yourself feels nice sometimes.kid, your family is middle class. and your father is a sensible man.

your life is what should be defined as Simple.Another shitpost...I don‚Äôt think your net worth is anywhere close to what you think it is. Your father is in debt that you don‚Äôt know about.While I do think the lifestyle you describe might be too frugal but it is your father's money and he gets to decide how to spend it. If you want a more expensive lifestyle, do it once you start earning.That money is accumulated by your dad by living a frugal life for years and investing a large chunk of his income. He has achieved it by not taking any debt and avoiding two money gazzlers in life - owning a house and a costly car. The balance he secured in life is for financial security. If he used to lead a flashy lifestyle then today his networth would probably be negetive.Either you have become the Buddha or this is some high quality shitpostTo be honest yeah thats way too frugal. The best question too ask is what are you going to do with all that money begs the question what is the purpose of life.Dude my dad has that ammount in bank. Along with same amount of worth in property. We don't have a car and the most expensive phone is my nokia 6.1 which I bought for 7k at sale.5 lakh cash and student? Something doesn't add up.Spend on items for yourself is directly related to how much you can earn and not how much you have saved.

Do not look at savings as your worth. That is the Banks job if you want debt.

At your level, see how much you (or father) earn. Part of that earnings go in savings, main household expense and balance for personal items.

If your father has made 5cr savings by saving 10k every month then you are living as per your means. While your friend, who you are comparing with, might have a higher earning income (and lesser savings).

Your savings is not your spending money.You friend is exaggerating. However, your lifestyle is kinda extra frugal too. A flat would be a good investment as you'll save on rent and it'll be useful when you get married later. A small used car may also be a good investment. Others have suggested AC too, but certain houses are designed in a way that it doesn't get very hot so you could decide based on your need. These are well below anything that might be considered extravagant at your position.

One more thing is that by the time you get married, you may need to consider upgrading further because most families would not accept a guy with no own house or with such frugal living, it's just how it is with our society.It wouldnt hurt to upgrade to Honda City and some new furniture.Your parents have their net worth in crores because they are so frugal. AC, safer car etc is a necessity though. Won't cost you much- but will add to your quality of life. Mercedes, iPhone etc in India is not a necessity. The taxes are very high making them unaffordable.Start earning and live as you like.you lost 2-3 crores in the stock market slump i.e you're almost 100% equities? For someone in their 20's that is dangerous. For someone with kids, that is criminally stupid. I don't know what to tell you.

To answer your question, 5 crores is around 700k USD, so not a lot but it's more than enough to live comfortably in india.I think you're living only one level more frugal than you need to..  No,a net worth of 5 crore doesn't make a Mercedes or a 30k mobile phone a good deal, they're still a waste of money. Potentially you should have an AC, a wifi connection if you have a need for it and a better car (Creta at most)

Your parents may have some reason to be risk averse you don't know of,like job stability issues, upcoming medical expenses,college fees,etc7-8 crore net worth is upper middle class at best",1586436257.0,fxrrfk,AskIndia,40,/r/india/comments/fxrrfk/are_we_living_way_too_frugally/,12,"My Dad has a networth of around 5 crores it was around 7-8 before the stock market slumped.

To showcase an example of how frugal we are 
We own an Alto 800.
We do not have an air conditioner even though temperatures regularly go above 45 degrees. 
We go out for dinner once in two-three months.
I barely spend more than 1500 rupees a month I am a college student.

This really made me think over because I find it okayish I mean there are a few things that could be done.

r/indiangirlsontinder8 matches so far in three days. Very few actually attractive women who are legit. 1 in 100 or 200.

If you're wondering why I'm bored and there aren't many Indian women where I live and of those I've either matched/dated or already gone out with a friend of. 

In terms of the passport feature my Tinder experiences in India are awful, I have family in Bombay so I chose there but I just couldn't get a single match for the longest time. I got two and those were similarly foreigners using the passport feature lol. I switched to Delhi where there seems to be on average better profiles - i.e. better grooming and style, more attractive and I got more matches there. 

Overall breakdown - 2 foreigners, 2 Bombay girls and 4 from Delhi. Still overall a really shitty return for three days. I did better in practically every other country I chose even in Pakistan or Japan,South Korea. 

I was hoping I'd do well in India as the older I grow the more attracted I am to Indian women and I can at least travel to India unlike Pakistan. Maybe it's because I have a muslim name or the distance shown changes things over there?

The call isn‚Äôt to stop exports but to be vocal against such bullying.We die[removed]I think one of the reason why people are demanding a ban on HCQ is the uncertainty towards the availability of HCQ for Indians at this crucial times. Ofcourse, it's stupid to think profit/being selfish here but its no brainer to understand the consequences if there's a shortage of the drug in the country. We never know how this pandemic thingy will end in India.  

As far as PPE and ventilators are concerned some PSUs have started making it already. Gwalior DRDE is manufacturing 200K masks each week whereas DRDO is using an adhesive which is used to build suits for paratrooper, to make PPEs/Hazmat suits. They are likely to produce around 15-20K PPEs every week. 

Baboon on  the other hand gave a clear indications of retaliation incase of a ban. I heard India already agreed to export HCQ to neighboring countries including US.Thing is, no one is against exports. But first, we need to think of our people. Imperialist countries like USA will pressure or force other counties for their interests. We don't need to bow down to compromise for our people's lives. No one will give us ventilators or PPE if there is shortage in their countries.India should be able to manufacture the majority of the PPE, drugs, etc. that she currently depends on other nations for. I especially believe this given India's large population. Morarji Desai had the right idea about fostering indigenous business in order to ensure self-reliance.

This is not a direct response to your post. I agree, actually. We should treat others the way we expect to be treated. But, with our large population, supposed rapid rate of development, etc. we really should be able to make all these things. Just another reason I find much of India's ""progress"" to be bogus.Bhakts: boycott Chinese goods

GoI: we have imported PPEs from China as we messed up on getting our PPE requirements in the tender sent out and WHO rapped us on our knuckles for thatWe should give help on humanitarian basis but are we? Are we really doing that? 

We only gave HCQ only because we were bullied. If we wanted to give it on humanitarian basis we wouldn't have imposed the ban on the first place.

We won't see ventilators until the first world has enough of them.Most of people I spoke with think India ""invented"" those medicines and has absolute control over the intellectual property and production. What a shitfest, India should and have to provide these generics as and when needed, part law part business commitmentsAm curious. Many states have. China was donated ppe and ventilator from india and other countries (Italy included).  

but seeing that it's charging Italy to get back its own donations, leave alone fresh ones are going to hard to get.. and then it's the quality control issues with many states Netherlands and Finland including highlighting issues.

Usa is actively cornering the market on PPE and ventilators, hijacking domestic orders and out bidding on international ones.

So good idea, but if this continues the only PPE and ventilators available will be the domestic ones. 

Countries are increasingly fighting for drugs and PPE and ventilators. So at the very least sending supplies to other countries must be after ensuring domestic supplies or getting a proper quid pro quo..Also this as well
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx465w/hydroxychloroquine_shortage_in_india_as_modi_govt/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareBullshit.

1.) Their is no argument against ban, as u/DonaldFarfrae mentioned the export could be done through special permission on humanitarian basis.

2.) There is no such thing as equality among countries. They don't like india and third world countries. They will not  hesitate to fuck up india for their own gains. And by they i specially mean NATO.

3.) HCQ could come under these 'special'  permission. BUT Ventilators and N-95 Masks are not, until we have atleast have enough to safeguard our medical premises and front liners specially.

Why do i absolutely dislike the idea of export?

Because they fucking don't give a shit about india. Throughout the history US have always considered us as a threat while india have always been generous. Our space missions are absolute eyesores for them. (Hypothetically, if countries like japan, Vietnam need it then there is no problem)

Never forget.I agree but they shouldn't have bent over to Trump's threats which mean absolutely nothing. Why should we show such incompetent 'diplomacy' any charity?We need to see that we have enough for ourselves first.then export.how can we give out meds  if our own will die for lack of the same.First of all. It's about India succumbing to Trump just as Modi spent a huge amount in welcoming Trump. By the way, USA has hijacked medical supplies that were enroute to the needy. USA has stopped supplying medical supplies to CANADA. TRUMP always wants to put AMERICA first and Indian PM Modi is acting like a perfect sucker. 

Iran has suffered the most and especially now because of the harsh trade restrictions. Trump did not ease them even during the Covid19. 

I mean Trump is giving all the supplies and the people here in India are asked to Clap and light candles. WTF!You are missing the point.

We don't have the capacity to manufacture the high grade PPE required for this pandemic . The local manufacturers need machines from foreign nations to make it . Hence we have to import them too

269,johnruby,"Authoritarianism never works. Whether it is with our own children or with the economy, it always messes things up in the long run. It's sad that our supreme leader wants to bring the same level of censorship and outright authoritarianism that China has, but without the economic growth. The worse part is that if you ask an average middle class Modi supporter  Indian about this, they're quite happy with their guy subverting democratic institutions in our country.Well, as a democracy, the US completely screwed up the response, including 

1. A president that took no action for 2months despite grave warnings
2. A federal government that  actively prevents states from getting the support they need
3. Senators selling their stocks using insider information while telling the public that everything is fine
4. Hospitals (they're for profit) operating at such a lean (cost avoidance) level, that they can't sustain even modest increases in patients, let alone a pandemic
5. People going bankrupt due to health care costs and job loss

So while I do not like the Chinese dictatorship, we shouldn't pretend that a capitalist democracy is some magic way of proper government. My hope is that India learns from both countries and comes out of this stronger and wiser as a nation.This pandemic has brought about a lot of ill-will for China. I think India should use this as an opportunity to present itself as an alternative to China as far as manufacturing is concerned. I am pretty sure that a lot of corporations would be looking at supply chain alternatives in case similar events happen in the future. India should strike while the iron is hotThe wet markets in China are in fact legal, not illegal like it is stated in the article. They were made legal in the 80s to combat lack of food, but it has become a luxury now.  China is now making a decision to change those laws.China doesn't care. 
Stop buying that Oppo or or Xiaomi phone, that MG Hector SUV, and then maybe they will.There a nations with democracy, who had sufficient warnings & still managed to mess up.

Sure you may blame China to react how most nations would behave when faced with a sudden crisis. But you gotta hand it to them for bringing it to control (within their borders) so fast.China will always be the elephant in the room for India.

Two massive populations next door to each other will always mean a head on collision into the near future.Problem is people of India think too highly of their flawed democracy.
Praising India's democracy is just another way of justifying cruelty of BJP government at center.
Silent majority of poor people in India suffers every day and people who praise this democracy are big reason for their suffering.If this pandemic started in India it would've been a lot worse due to India having less capacity for PCR testing than China, as well as less of a capacity for lockdowns and contact tracing. There were 50k cases in Wuhan alone officially and possibly up to 500k if you don't believe Chinese numbers. How many would there have been in Mumbai if it started there?While authoritarian China did make mistakes, let us not forget that many democratic governments dealt with the crisis even worse than China. 

Yes, things could have been better if there was more transparency and freer press on China. But we supposedly have all those things in Italy, in UK, in the US, and yet their governments were refusing to react even after it became clear that there was going to be a pandemic. There had been enough information coming out of China by mid January for the rest of the world to act. Yet, they didn't. Why?

China is an easy target, but blaming only them deflects from the most fundamental reason for the failure to stop this pandemic.

The world failed to stop the virus because  of the blind race towards economic growth that we are so beholden to in our capitalist societies. The world was to afraid to to take steps that would cut the profits of large companies until it had no other choice left. That is why we failed to stop this pandemic. Not only because of China.That's not the reason the virus spread to the rest of the world though. It's a highly contagious disease. It spread really fast before anyone could figure out how serious it was. Even if they'd been transparent, they'd have slowed it down at best.

Sure, that may have saved lives, and for that you can blame China and several other countries for not taking it seriously. But we couldn't have totally stopped it.If anything they bounced back despite being the epicenter of the virus. Democracies ate still fighting over tests, fake news and over an unproven anti malarial.China has lifted millions out of poverty & has absolute control over rich citizens. In democratic countries, billionaires fund & control leaders, lobby political parties for favorable policies to keep working class poor forever.But Sanghis want dictatorship. They think it's the only way to save India.wait... india is democratic ??As much as I hate Chinese authoritarianism, I am getting more and more annoyed at these articles. China acted extremely swiftly under the circumstances. And it was that same authoritarianism which allowed them to act that swiftly. They were able to ignore a lot of human rights violations to clamp down hard and fast on the virus.

Going by the article, China took 23 days to do the unprecedented lockdown in Hubei (which was condemned at the time by most). When did India realise that things were bad? Lockdown didn't happen till end of March in India. Most other countries are still not in lockdown. The US still has mayors and governers actively denying the need for a lockdown while thousands die.Unfortunately, democracy is turned into namocracy in India & is heading right in the direction of totalitarian state.
At least Xi was personally on the ground directing the lockdown policy while ours is only coming on 'doorr darshan' asking to clap & light lamps without even charting out a single action plan in these bhashans (silence is bliss/maunam sarwartha sadhanam policy)
Also in China, whatever the down sides of their authoritarian system, at least there was no attempt by their government to give the communal spin to it. 
The way migrant workers panicked and started exodus out of cities in India was the direct result of lack of advance planning & rescue plan charting in these addresses..This did not happened in China thus restricting the intra-country spread outside of Wuhan..

What China later did with sealing Wuhan was exactly what India & other countries should have done in 2nd half of Jan 2020 to their major intl airport hotspots such as Mumbai, Delhi, Banglore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad along with all major sea ports & land border check posts with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal & Bhutan. By not doing so till March 2020 Indian central gov allowed internal 2nd stage spread from incoming intl travelers to other locals. Many of these were labor force & domestic migrant workers coming in close contacts with these primary spreaders, which later left these local city zones in panic & thus spreading the virus in internal c & d tier towns & villages (Empty railway platforms, school buildings & grounds, empty toll plazas, petrol pumps etc. could have been setup as relief camps for these workers in advance to keep them within these city limits...small make shift clinics & food distribution centers could have been setup in dense lower middle class & slum localities to provide rapid & approachable response centers.) About 60%  of migrant workers in cities work for realty sector...their respective employer builder companies shouid have been contacted in advance with financial help for distribution to these workers. None of this was done before declaring the lock down and thus raising valid panic amongst the lower middle class & poor strata of Indian society..I would give it a couple of months before jumping to this conclusion. Indian government still has a lot of opportunity to completely fuck up the situation. And going by how effectively the Tablighi jamaat situation was handled, I am 100% sure that they would not disappoint.unfortunately, the wrong lesson would be learnt.

that an authoritarian govt could totally keep a lid on catastrophe easily than a Democratic one.

the same model will be localized. Gujarat model to China modelDemocracy in name & stature is useless.  
The spirit and implementation should happen at all levels.  
Just being 'democractic' does not bring in an utopia of well being for everyone.    

Transparency is key. Govt's, be it communist or capitalist need to be transparent.  
A non transparent govt. will only lead to one point of failure - the lack of trust.  
Put you short comings and failure on record, in public as whole without data being fudged.Trump has repeatedly lied about C-19 but he lies about everything.True. We need democracy where press can work freely and people can criticise and protest the government. The recent CAA protests has just proved my point.Bro, have you ever heard of 'murica? The freest country in the entire world, as they claim. Ever heard about the snowden leaks?

China is a communist nation, in which, Jack Ma, a billionaire is a member of the communist party, just let that sink in.

Democracy and communism aren't so much the issues, but oversight is.

These political stooges think they aren't answerable to anyone, and that has to change.Germany, Italy and US have democracy. What did they do?Or maybe what India needs is communism :PModi is a brand , real üß† brain is some else someone else bald guy with specs I wonder whoAny communist setup never works, this is just an example, a communist setup always needs capital braces be it manufacturing for china, energy for russia or nothing for North Korea,  try explaining this to a person with communist bent, and he will tell you otherwise!

b.) Restaurant is delaying food prep :

It is highly unlikely that the doctors so blatantly refuse to treat someone based on religion. We are not on that level yet.I'm mad at this guy, but I'm even more mad at journalists who blatantly lied few days ago even without doing basic investigation. Why? Because they saw potential  Hindu-Muslim angle, one of the most inflammatory topic in this country right now. 

The man is not very educated but these journalists sure are. And that minister who made a video without solid details of the case- he should publically apologize and resign.

Doctor's name was revealed in all the articles as well, those journalists almost sabotaged his career. That doctor should file defamation suit against those journalists and news channels.

Members of this sub are no better, most of them jumped to conclusion even though there was not enough details in any of those articles.Some people are justifying his act here saying he is not mentally stable or he is uneducated. Some are saying that he is not muslim because real muslim can't lie. This is the exact reason why RW is able to create mass hatred among Hindus towards muslim.

We need to criticize every bad deed irrespective of religion. You can't get away just because you are minority or uneducated or you claim that you are not mentally stable.

Also media is also wrong here by playing on the communal lines. But media has been like this for ever. This is not something new. Now we have a responsibility to criticize every person who is doing something wrong irrespective of his religion.He should be jailed.In an already complicated world and a complicated year, people are creating more confusion. Amazing.Jail the fucker.Shame on him, this guy should be jailed.

We were on a trip. 8 people: 2 girls, 1 gay dude and 5 straight boys. During night, we were all drunk and playing mafia before we decided to sleep. There were 2 rooms. In each room there was a king bed for 3 persons and a sofa bed for a single person. Now I couldn't sleep on sofa because I was tall. We thought girls will sleep on sofa beds or the gay guy would sleep with girls. But as we ended our game, girls occupied a big bed and the gay guy occupied sofa bed. 4 boys immediately left for the other room and I had no choice but to sleep with girls. 

Now here comes the shitty part. I was drunk AF and I am kicky person. I was sure if I sleep in this condition I will probably kick the girl beside me to death. So I was awake for most of night and then went to sleep anyway.Fake.

This instructable does something similar. 
I don't think it will be a very practical solution for normal Indian homes though. Getting the fan enclosure to exactly fit the window would be tough, expensive and possibly ugly. Also, if you use a HEPA, you cannot use bidirectional air flow (not sure about this one). 

An AC is still the best and cheapest bet, although this might be a good hobby project.",1586422659.0,fxp1uj,AskIndia,3,/r/india/comments/fxp1uj/filtered_whole_house_air_exchanger_diy/,8,"Had an idle idea for a DIY project to be done post lockdown, thoughts on this? During summers apartments get quite hot during the daytime, and night time temps are typically 5-10 degrees lower. At night (around 11pm-midnight) the indoor temp is often 5 degrees or more higher than the outdoor temp. Opening windows to promote air exchange is a rather slow process and also results in dust coming in, hence we end up running an AC for 20-30 min to cool just one room. 

&#x200B;

Instead, is it practical to have a high volume intake fan attached to a window, with a HEPA filter. Run this intake fan for a few minutes to flush out the air inside the room with fresh air from outside through the filter. This would instantly cool the room to the outside temp, and also instead of running an AC consuming 1000-1500W, the initial reduction would come from a fan consuming 100 watts or so.

\-BhaktI am from the Pharmaceutical manufacturing/R&D sector and for the last 3 weeks this has been a running joke in our circle.

The Ipca unit was hit with the worst of the worst 483s for data integrity violations and couldn't pull through with an approval for 4 years.
Now they have got approval from the USFDA without even getting inspected. It shows what a desperate situation the world is in.

The problem is even in India we have just a couple of companies that produce the HCQ API, the other being Zydus/Cadila if I'm not wrong. Both these companies manufacture primarily for the export market.

This is also the reason why a lot of us Pharmaceutical professionals are still working round the clock despite the lockdown, in bad conditions, some even without DC approvals, to try and cope with medical needs (not just HCQ but other medication as well).No shit bro, People are dying and they are desperateThere is some anecdotal evidence of it improving peoples chances, though a proper clinical trial will take time.

It was an iconic structure for motorists using the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. But it had been in a state of disuse for several years. The bridge was opened on November 10, 1830, as a key connector between Mumbai and Pune. 
 
It got its name due to a massive hoarding of Amrutanjan at the location. It later served as the third line for the Railways on the Bor ghat section to reverse engines. But that was later stopped after more powerful engines were introduced.
 
The wide pillars of the bridge caused a steep turn due to which vehicles traveling to Mumbai were bound to meet with accidents daily
 
Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation had received permission to demolish the bridge in 2017. But the high volume of traffic on the expressway gave them no window to execute it

A few days after the lockdown was announced, MSRDC sought permissions to pull it down. Holes were drilled in 15 to 20 locations on each of its six piers. With simultaneous detonation, the bridge was brought down at 6.20 p.m. The plaque commemorating the opening of the bridge has been preserved.I heard there were a lot of accidents. Right?I once traveled on it.

No one is expecting private labs to absorb the cost of the tests. Government has to compensate them for this eventually. People are not free to get tested by choice. There are strict requirements in place before you can get tested at these labs. So, the bigger picture is that by making it free, you are encouraging people showing symptoms to come forward and visit a doctor to see if they should be tested. We are at a very crucial stage and we need more and more people to get tested. Expecting people to pay 4500 for tests voluntarily is just elitist behaviour. It‚Äôs not like there is a shortage of funds. PM Cares has 6500 crores last I heard. World Bank is giving a billion dollars iirc. If you are not even going to use that money for testing‚Ä¶ what good is it going to do? Just Rs. 45 crores would do one lakh tests. India seems to have done a total of just 1.27 lakh tests until now!

If you want to contain the virus... This is the least this government can do. Especially when one tweet from PM would once again boost the number of donations to PM Cares.Not a good decision. Policy decisions are best left to the government. What if the government is unable to finance these free tests? The private players will simply stop testing. 

I firmly believe the testing should be free. But that should be done by the government after considering all aspects. Not by judges.This is idiocy. Who is the SC to interfere in this completely non legal matter? How will the private lab pay their employees? Are they slaves? The simple common sense solution is to offer to cover the costs. This sort of bullshit will just convince labs to shut down or focus on other profitable endeavors when they can contribute.This will hurt patients ultimately. Having to do it free of cost would mean that private operators would have no incentive to maintain quality, since they would rather see patients go to a competitor.

Supreme Court, as has become the norm, is speaking out of its ass. They are in a race with the government as to who destroys the country first.This obsession of India to provide everything for free is why we are, where we are and why Indian industry and innovation is in dire straits. 

Absolutely no respect for the businesses and entrepreneurs in this country.

Ask the Govt to pay up or fuck off, private entities aren't obliged to provide anything for free.Sometimes I wonder which wing of democracy is more harmful to the country...Jab price cap kia tha to logo ko dikkat thi k gareeb log kaise karwayenge testing ab jb free kr dia to bhi problem k free kaise kr dia üòÇüòÇSC told they don't have expertise on migrant labour's to pass any Judgment but full swing in private businessI'd be very curious to know what law gives the Supreme Court the authority to just make shit up like this. Making policy is supposed to be purely in the executive and legislative domain. For an organ of the government obsessed with its independence they seem to not really care about the autonomy of the rest of the countryIf I didn't know the sub before reading comments I would have believed I stumbled onto r/conservative or the other Indian sub. Who are these people commemting here?

Test of this disease should absolutely be free compensated by the government. If private labs only want to test symptomatic people, that's fine. But you would most definitely de incentivize people from getting tested with a hefty price and virus will keep on spreading. Govt cannot afford it nonsense is horseshit.

Wtf is going on here?‚ù§Ô∏è Supreme ‚Ñ¢ court ‚ù§Ô∏èThe Supreme Court effectively killed private testing. We need more testing not less.Government said private labs could not charge more than 4500, guess what private labs have decided to charge.4500, no matter the cost of the kit.They do not care about lives, only profit.


No poor man is gonna go to a private lab , that will only build up a backlog at government labs and will result in even more delay in testing and waiting time.

Goverment should be the procurer and supplier and  should make tests  free . 
in case of coronavirus , we need free healthcare for everyone.Medical costs are a big driving factor in driving people into poverty.Many people would be losing jobs by the time this will  be over and their savings will get wiped out if treatment is not free.

Free does not mean they will not get money, they will get money but from government.What the actual fuck ?!?

Will become free if this gets implementedRs 4,500 is the upper limit that can be charged for the tests. And you have obviously not read the news about the Supreme Court ordering tests to be free.

There is not much reason for anyone and everyone to get tested, and if the tests are actually made ""public"", which is to say that anyone who wants one can get one, then we will certainly run short of test kits and won't be able to test those who actually need to be tested.

The more we test, the better, obviously. But even that needs to be done methodically, not ad hoc.Yesterday Supreme said the testing must be free in private labs.

It's about how they become free. We still have to pay the private labs money. The people who work there aren't slaves, they have families. Just because they're making a necessary commodity doesn't mean you can ask them to give you free stuff.

There's no issue if the government comes up with a plan to subsidize this amount. What's completely stupid is asking the labs to work for free with no plan to reimburse them.

I think the more we test the more accurate a picture we get of the magnitude of problem.

Edit : The basic premise behind this query is that we need more testing to happen and that is high priority.

OP fine work, thanks buddy.Wouldn't it be better to invest in Mutual Funds via something like Kuvera, PayTM Money, Groww, Goalwise etc? Any of these non demat platforms instead of Zerodha, which I believe stores them on Demat account?>  So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is ‚Äì why we need to invest. It‚Äôs because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That‚Äôs called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1.¬†Share Market¬†‚Äì
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India‚Äôs largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that‚Äôs called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their¬†coin.zerodha.com¬†to trade mutual funds. It‚Äôs free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It‚Äôs easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3.¬†Insurance¬†:
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party ‚Äì first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that‚Ä¶

But only death benefit, else you won‚Äôt get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.","Finance Basics ‚Äì Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/
307,haphazardwizardofoz,"First of all, congratulations on the offer! Legaltech and regtech are growing rapidly so this is an exciting space to be in. Some points off the top of my head:

* These guys approached you which means you have skills that are desirable in the market. Depending on how big that market is, you'll want to make sure that you're not undervaluing yourself
* Despite the above, just because one company thinks you're a good fit doesn't necessarily mean there will be many others, but it's a good indication
* The company having the backing of an established law firm is very positive. It might be worth asking a bit more about the details of the backing. What does the incubator provide? How long can they stay in the incubator? Is/has the incubator invested in the company?
* A passionate and hardworking founder is always encouraging, however that can mean that you will also be expected to be as passionate and hardworking. In startup terms that means long hours and sacrificing your free time. However, you're young so that's less of a concern right now.
* Ask for a copy of the equity contract as the devil is in the details. Equity deals can take many forms, some are great and some are worthless. Shares/share options can get quite complicated so review it carefully. Get advice from someone if needs be, but make sure that you 100% understand the deal.
* Being close to the office is a big deal. Commuting in shitty traffic for 2 hours a day is a killer. Being able to use that time for something else, gym, reading, socialising is invaluable. We live in an age where time is the most valuable resource. Cherish it.
* How do you put a price on all of this? Well, what kind of salary could you expect if you applied for a job elsewhere? To keep the numbers simple, let's say the average salary is 10k. How much do you need to live on and support yourself? Let's say that you can get by on 5k. Most equity deals are vested over a period of a few years. So let's say 3 years. Just multiply 5000\*12\*3 = 1,80,000. Now double that because you're taking on an a lot of risk working for an early stage startup and we arrive at 3,60,000. So you'd expect to receive share options with a value of ca. 3.6 lakh. Given that the company is on its way to a funding round, they should have an idea of the current value, which translates that 3.6l in to a number of shares. The type of shares will be another conversation.

All in all, this sounds like a good opportunity! If you use some common sense and make sure that everything is done as legitimately as possible, you'll be able to protect yourself.

Ultimately, you're young and can afford to take a risk like this year. Worst case scenario, the company will flop and you'll be out of a job in 6 months or a year. But hopefully you would have gained some amazing experience in that time which will help propel your career.

Hope that helps!",1586424183.0,fxpcir,Business/Finance,1,/r/india/comments/fxpcir/is_this_a_good_deal/,5,"Hey guys.
Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest.

""I knew I would get to learn a lot more at Amazon"" will always be a good reason to leave any company to join Amazon (or FB, Goog.. etc.)Please leave if have an option . You will learn hell lot more in Amazon, earn better pay and social status too.          
Smaller companies are good if your are the founder or at a very top position. They drain the employees and pay much lesser. So no point working unless you have no other option.Some unsolicited advice about the salary, view the bonuses and stocks as one time. Your base is going up from 14 to 16, but expect a drop in in-hand salary once your bonus gets over and do not expect to receive too many stocks until you get promoted to SDE 2

&#x200B;

Amazon does not require you to perform better than other SDE 1's, even if they are paid less, but SDE 1 is an entry level role so if you do not get promoted within 3-4 years you'll practically be fired. As an experienced guy, you'll be given the opportunity to leverage your experience for a faster promo but you dont need to take it up. 

&#x200B;

Oncall in some teams can be hell. 

&#x200B;

Go in knowing the tradeoff. I made a similar jump 3 years ago and I'm fairly happy with it, but I know people who had a very idealistic view when jumping and they're disappointed",1586395643.0,fxj7u5,AskIndia,4,/r/india/comments/fxj7u5/cs_career_question_leaving_lesser_known_company/,14,"I work at a lesser known company in India as SDE. Joined fresh out of a good college at okay salary (around 14 LPA total compensation). Never got a chance to interview for Amazon in college so took a chance and interviewed and got selected(the interview wasn't very difficult and I didn't do very well in the difficult round)

Pros:
The increment I am getting in my current compensation is huge (9+ lakh, this includes bonus as well with base around 16), not counting the stocks
I am also getting a brand name for my resume
Work on higher scale. Also, current company has lots of tech debt and not a very clear plan for future whereas Amazon's team looks good
Current company is not growing very fast and although we have been assured no layoffs due to corona, I don't exactly trust the senior management
I will have better opportunities ( non tech as well) at amazon

Cons:
Leaving so early makes me look greedy for future employers

I love the culture at my current team ( no on-call, friendly people but not exceptionally knowledgeable)

I work much more efficiently (for 12 hrs daily currently and like it) and am very deadline oriented but in a friendly environment where there's not much anxiety about getting fired which I believe is opposite of Amazon's culture

With this high salary there would surely be higher expectations as fresh grads who will join with me will be getting 20% less base than me so what if I can't get the job done and I won't even be able to leave in case things don't work out as I already would have left current company in 4-5 months


Can someone experienced help me make a decision.

321,ThakGayaHu,"The people here are way too nice. As someone who has been through the US MBA process, let me tell you - HBS, with an admit rate of 10%, is a crapshoot even for the most exceptional candidates in the world. If you're an Indian male engineer, your chances are nigh impossible. 

The real question here is, why do you even need an MBA from HBS? Why not some other good MBA from the US or somewhere else? The reason you gave in your comment is way too shallow, and no MBA school, let alone HBS, would admit you even if you are a truly exceptional candidate. 

If you want my advice - forget about MBA for a couple of years, introspect and identify what your goals are, work hard at it, and then ask yourself if you even need an MBA to pursue your goals. If yes, understand that you're at an inherent disadvantage just for being an Indian male engineer and set your sights on a more realistic target.

> but for HBS only GMAT is not enough.

For any respectable MBA school, just GMAT is not enough.I am a US MBA student who went through the process. 

HBS would admit like 4-5 Indian male engineers every year as MBA classes need to be diverse. You need to ask yourself an honest question: ‚ÄúWhat makes me one of the top 5 applicants in this group?‚Äù 

If your answer is that you‚Äôre from IIT or have a 780 GMAT, your application goes straight into trash. You need to put in work for several years to get on HBS level. Read the profiles of admitted students. There are children‚Äôs of heads of states, people who have swum across the transatlantic, endorsed by big CEOs, generated millions of dollars of revenues, led multiple successful startups etc. All these candidates also have a solid idea of what they want to achieve in life and how the HBS MBA will get them there. This tells the admission committee how you, as an alumni, will benefit the Harvard brand and keep it the school everyone aspires to go to. It would make the HBS network stronger. If your goal in life is as shallow as ‚ÄúI want an HBS MBA because it‚Äôs a sexy college that will get me a high paying corporate job‚Äù, then you will be of no benefit to future Harvard students and the college network. 

This is why Harvard admitted Rahul Gandhi. Not because he was smart, but because it‚Äôs really beneficial for them to have a potential PM in their network. 

So, your tier 3 college is not a big deal at all. But if you want HBS, you need to work hard, get some solid achievements to speak for you, and do a LOT of introspection about where you are and what you want from life. Again, reading essays/resume/profiles of admitted students of your background will give you a much better perspective.Colleges like Harvard, don't just focus on your acads, they are looking for what profile so you have - acads, extra curricular, social activities, what experiences you bring on the table, what's your purposes of doing an MBA and so on. 

Cut short - they look at whole of you + great GMAT scores.Nothing is impossible. If you work hard and get the right GMAT scores, you have a chance. It's not the college that matters, it's the effort you've put in and what you've achieved is what matters. Good luckWhy do you want to go to HBS?What you do after the college matters more than what college you come from, 4 of my colleagues got into HBS in last 2 years, 3 of them from IITD, one from a Tier-III regional college.Let me make this even worse for you. 

Forget about HBS, give CAT and once you reach exceptional %ile, then try to apply in top ABC IIMs and see how things get twisty for a tier 3 college guy. It's not impossible but makes your job a lot tougher. 

Any exlemprary life achievements? How were your board scores?I have known people from tier 3 colleges who went on to do their PhDs/MBAs from the very best schools in the world. It is not impossible but you need to have an exceptional profile. To make that happen, you need to have at least 3/4 years of work ex, publications in journals, >90 percentile GMAT and great LORs.You need an exceptional profile to get into HBS. Great academics, great extracurricular activities, community service and a good personality. Can a 3rd tier college kid get into HBS - sure, but now you have to compensate for the lousy academics with something else.

Getting a GMAT score that is acceptable is the easiest task of the lot because it is all about paying for a test and studying some basic stuff that you studied till 9th or 10th. 

One potential option is - you work hard after graduation and make a difference. Not to yourself, but to a lot of people. Such activities generally do seem to get you some chance of getting into a top 10 school.",1586414714.0,fxnhj1,AskIndia,18,/r/india/comments/fxnhj1/is_it_impossible_to_get_admission_into_harvard/,3,"Hi, I tried to collect information about this on Google.

Fucking real estate assholes.To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail.Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate.REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
I'm




2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset.

***LOCK ‚Äì ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would‚Äôve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world‚Äôs population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today‚Äôs situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren‚Äôt performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúOut of Adversity comes Opportunity‚Äù. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‚ÄòHome‚Äô is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector‚Äôs growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India‚Äôs GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector‚Äôs contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India‚Äôs GDP by 2025.

¬∑ **Real Estate ‚Äì Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India‚Äôs Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

¬∑ **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

¬∑ **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

¬∑ **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

¬∑ **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

¬∑ **Long Term ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Wealth Building Asset with ‚ÄúPredictable ‚Äú Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Capital Appreciation in long term**, don‚Äôt be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company‚Äôs stock price or your bank‚Äôs health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

¬∑ **‚ÄúHelps you Raise Money Quickly‚Äù** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

¬∑ **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **‚ÄúWine and Real Estate improve with Age‚Äù** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

¬∑ **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

¬∑ **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

¬∑ **Co-living market** size across India‚Äôs top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

¬∑ **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

¬∑ India‚Äôs improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why ‚Äì**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand ‚Äì Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it‚Äôs time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor‚Äôs portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual‚Äôs cash flow and wealth.

**‚ÄúBUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don‚Äôt WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

They just gain pleasure from spreading BS.I just thought of few ideas which can hopefully try to stop this mess using tech. 

 

1) Whatsapp can provide an option of ""Share as verified"" something like what we have in microsoft outlook ""send secure"" feature. Of course, being end to end encrypted, this facility and processing has to be provided in the app itself. Imagine you get an unknown video but would like to validate it before sharing. Click on this button and whatsapp crawls the web for the upload details of original video and then timestamps it. You can send the verified video with encoded timestamps to the groups.

2) Maybe google/ servers who host videos can implement it. Lets say in this case, someone searched on google for a video with keywords ""muslim"" ""naked"" ""hospital"" and the resultant video was published as Tabliqhi Jamaat member. Can google/ servers/twitter who hosted the original video add both time stamp and location stamp on such videos. Think this can be done using some script. I am no coder but if google found this video multiple times in its search, it can tag this video based on original date and location of first upload. Additionally, this hypothetical script can search for key words which are deemed inflammatory. This could help in reducing fake content for people to suit their narrative.

IT guys - Is this possible?Many of the scumbags who share these fake news are followed by the PM himself.",1586333124.0,fx2fvh,Coronavirus,14,/r/india/comments/fx2fvh/old_video_from_pakistan_falsely_viral_as_tablighi/,221,,Old video from Pakistan falsely viral as Tablighi Jamaat member roaming naked in isolation ward,https://www.altnews.in/old-video-from-pakistan-shared-as-tablighi-jamaat-member-roaming-naked-in-isolation-ward/

The guy was beaten up badly, all for a meme. The minister even posted on twitter, justifying the violence.Imagine studying for years to become an engineer and then getting beaten by an illiterate.Over using the word alleged, don't you think? Or is it just because the person is not a Sanghi?Sometimes I wish some meteor would fucking  wipe the entire humanity out of existence.Okay , previous comment was my bad, i accept it. 
There should be legal action similar to case of reporter.if someone wants to post such pics, they should make sure to use a new handle, tor browser and such to be anonymous.I think this could be the least worst, you have people who are murdered ministers and nothing happens to them.You know the gunda lobby. If not then please see how many FIRsare registered for your local politicians.He is a strong grassroot leader and very influential among the minority community.I'm of the opinion that violence should always be condemned and punished, but personal threats (which includes threats to rape family members) should also be equally condemned and punished. Awhad's justification is that he has been threatened in such way on social media (Source: [https://twitter.com/awhadspeaks/status/1247765336813752323?s=21](https://twitter.com/awhadspeaks/status/1247765336813752323?s=21))

I don't want to defend activities of both the parties in this, but the only question that arises in my mind is why didn't he file a FIR against such threats first and let the police do their job?

Edit: grammarRW assholes defend these actions when BJP leaders/supporters do it. They got a taste of their medicine now.

The number of people who have been attacked because they criticized Modi and Yogi is scary. This asshole wants to imitate them.

Btw, the guy who is beaten up is a Sanghi who threatened others.How credible is this? He's an engineer with the state department. These are known to be Sanghi types. I wouldn't be surprised if he's linked to BJP and RSS.Although i condemn the brutality of awhad, the picture made by this engineer is also stupid, defaming and completely wrong.

India doesn't have the capacity to make any of them . Should they behave like that too ?

We don't have the capacity to manufacture ventilators . We import them .

We don't have the capacity to manufacture the high grade PPE required for this pandemic . The local manufacturers need machines from foreign nations to make it . Hence we have to import them too 

We don't have the capacity to make advanced drugs . India mostly makes generic medicines . Hence we need to import them too .

Now think of the pain and hardship if other nations retaliate against India and ban the exports of above mentioned items to India as tit-for-tat move for our ban on exported of HCQ to them .

Move on.Ok what I'm about to say is super harsh. Dude you invested way too much both emotionally and financially in a woman who doesn't give a fuck (clearly evident). It'll never workout even if she magically wakes up tomorrow morning and decided to become a sensible, caring woman. You're lucky cuz you get an exit option before shit fucks your life up. The classic Reddit advice is applicable for you too ( to a certain extent) : lawyer up, delete Facebook and hit the gym.Op forget her and move on. You should be glad she left you before there is any marriage or kids involved.Her point of view is valid. A man, or a woman, can walk out of a relationship anytime they want. Even without an explanation. They have the right to do that.

Considering her background, it is entirely understandable that she wants to have a life of no worries. You might feel the same in her situation. 

If she actually marries you, chances are the discontent would always remain. And that will be very bad for your marriage. You would know her discontent even if she hides it, and you would not trust her completely, ever.

Drop it. For your own peace of mind. You two are NOT compatible. Compatibility is about having great emotional as well as ideological connect, connect on how to handle life etc. You two do not have that.

None of this is your fault. Its not hers either. You two have different ideas of life. And as someone married 18 years, let me tell you that having different ideas of what life should be is a marriage breaker. Do not regret this.

You do your thing, try harder, make a life of your own. Someone who is more suitable would turn up, someone who who feels and thinks like you.Well.

Happy healing.Brother, I was in the same boat as you.. my advice- move on !! You are young and there is plenty of fish in the sea..>me being poor

You're not poor

>1 year

Personal exp, give more time than this for a love marriage.

>she would marry someone richer

There will always be someone richer. Even after she marries she'll always found someone is richer than her husband. And she's not a world class beauty or supermodel, that sone businessman is gonna want to marry her. Everyone has a value, you give something and then you get something. She's over estimating her value

>groom is expected to be earning more than bride

Expected to be older than bride and get dowry too.

>She wants to rest

Rest from what? Work. She's not of the retirement age. And i don't think she has worked in some job with occupational hazard, that she needs rest. If she wants to be a housewife, well fine by her, but her husband won't probably keep a maid, coz that'll become her work from then on.

>What should I do ?

Break up, if that's not happened, block her number, fb, whatsapp, ask one of your friends to delete her pics from your phone, and avoid meeting her even by chance. There are thousands of girls, smarter and kinder than her.Get over her. Not worth it. Move on.
You will find many other girls. Settle with a girl who sees your worth and not the wealth/materials you possess.Let's say even if you earn enough money in 2years that she agrees to marry you. What happens after? You are setting a wrong precident. Going forward she might keep on demanding stuff and you will keep doing it for her. I don't think it will be a happy marriage. It's better to move on.Good riddance. Too young. Move on man.Take off your rose-colored glasses and look at all the red flags. Move on, Run!Money has more worth for her than you. So best option is to move on.If you can buy a house in just 3 years. I don't think you're poor man.Avoid gold diggers like a plague (or coronavirus if you will). Dump her, you deserve a lot better. Also, even if she comes back later as she fails to find the groom of her dreams, don't fall into the trap again.

I've seen gold diggers destroy the guys' lives in multiple cases. You'll be miserable and be taunted at your inadequacy to provide for her your entire life if you do get her to marry you.Nothing. Just let her go. You are just 22 dude. You have a long life ahead.Well brother, like some wise man once said "" It's better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."" Calm down, grab a beer and enjoy. You dodged a bullet.Thanks to everyone for helping me out and made me introspect to look at the things.


I have realised that you can't force someone to love you, if they want to leave they will leave you by making any excuse and they have all the right to leave you at any point of time.


I should accept things as they are and should move on which is best for both of us .



She is right in her pov and I shouldn't force my decision on her.


If I ain't capable of handling a breakup then it's not her mistake, I should have taken consideration of all the consequences.



Hopefully I will move on .

/sSorry to burst your bubble kiddo, but she was never in love with you. 

People in love work together, I suggest you follow passion and the next time you find someone who not only thinks about her future, but your combined future :)

IMO, you dodged a bullet because she clearly only wants to be rich today, perhaps tomorrow she might need love - It's Maslow's Hierarchy of needs. You should look for someone who is on the same level as you are, philosophically.She has made her views clear, it is understandable that she wants a stable life, but at the same time, if you somehow convence her to stay and you do give her the ""stable"" life she wants, eventually in the future if you fail to do so, she will leave. And when you're in a relationship you need to be there in both ups and downs not just ups, so for your sake and hers, it would be best that you both walk you seperate ways.Dude, someone out there deserves your love more than her. Consider this a good riddance and move TF on. Keep focusing on your career but for your own damn self, not for someone else.When people leave us when are not at our best, then it‚Äôs not true love. Hence, let her go and move on.
I am sure you‚Äôll find someone else.Move on! Catch another fish. Plenty of fishes in the sea.Get riches, fuck bitches.My first girlfriend left me after 5 months when I was 19, because I was too poor. Now I'm 41, a doctor, with net worth of $1M and no debts.If a woman has said she is not interested in you, it's mean you probably missed 5-6 signals she gave to you on the matter. It's sad for you. But it's over. Same thing happened with me also few years ago.Don‚Äôt be a SIMP bro. Leave her before she starts fucking your life moreLet her go if she only needs money, She might leave later on because of some setback in your business or job, it's better she leaves now than later on with your kids and half of your property or she might be fucking some other guys behind your back.

You can get rich and shove the success right in her face, That's how it works. That's the ""only"" way it will work.

Edit: Actually wait, being a guy every guy thinks he's a saint and she is wrong (self-criticism), which is true many times.

A girl needs an assurance, Not every girl will trust you blindly as well, else than blaming her you should look at yourself and look at the flaws in yourself.

1. For how long you guys been dating?
2. Was she supportive before she said these things?
3. Do you procrastinate things you need to do to become successful?
4. Were you financially dependent on her before this?
5. Did she give you enough chances to convince her that you are trying?
6. Are you involved in any bad habits?

P.S. talk to her after self-analysis, sometimes people do say things when they are angry. If you are right and she is the gold digger types then it's time to move on but make sure you do a detailed self-analysis before that.I read this relationship advise somewhere on quora and I paraphrase. 


Do not delude yourself into thinking that one girl can make you happy. Happiness is a choice,   you can choose to do good things, make good choices. Additionally, being indepently happy will make you a good partner and a source of stability for a worthy woman.A person doesn't ever truly know another person. They have a whole life, years and years of memories and experiences. You cannot ever know what they have felt in situations, what has happened to them, what made them who they are. So you cannot judge a person ever, not unless you somehow manage to learn their whole life.


Meg


She has chosen her option, it's time to cut loose. You don't just stop loving someone suddenly.

Either they never did love you, or this has been cooking up in their head since a very long time. I'm sorry OP the one who does the breakup will have 
gone over this scenario multiple times. It's not easy for you. But stick in there. You got this üí™Self - explanatory read the para you just wrote a couple of times and you will understand what people are trying to say here. The top comments already have commented appropriate things in my opinion just a nut a few times (post nut clarity is a thing ) and then make a decisionI would say you should move on but in the end it's your decision, I mean you've been together for
3 years so you should know better.Good riddance.Let her go bro. It's over.Bro. Don't even worry about it. At all. DM me if you want to talk about it on phone or video call.Cut your loses and make a run, mate. It'd be painful now but it is completely detrimental to your relationship in the long run now that she has revealed her cards. In a way, you should be thankful for her honesty, thank her for her time, and simply move on before it becomes toxic.

Can you convince her? Sure. Are you prepared to be blamed life-long for anything and everything? Go ahead and woo her back. What I can tell you is the cost you would pay wouldn't be worth it, not in a million years.

That said, this situation you're in right now is an easier thing to understand but a harder thing to endure. I wish you my best. Take a decision and don't apologise.This sounds like a bummer but my man, you're 22 and in hindsight later this is going to be the LEAST painful decision you're going to have made. Just hunker down, respect her decision, and keep going on with life. You'll do well, take care.Let her go. This is the moment for you to show strength. You will, in the coming time, wake up to the fact that love is not the thread that was supposed to bind life and make it beautiful.

If she's saying no, she's decided in her own mind to go and there's little you can do about it. It's not a small thing that she's saying, that you can convince her against with arguments.

Also, she's not the right one for you. The right one won't have put you in this situation. The only thing you can do, if you still want to have her, is to let her be totally free and she'll come back. And then you can decide if she's worth your future or not. 

DON'T GO AFTER HER. SHE'LL RUN AWAY FASTER.

The girl behind u/wanderingmind and all girls like her, and girls in general have a different way of thinking and love doesn't matter to them as much.

Was getting married the goal of your relationship? It should not be.

Being married is not the quality of a successful relationship, being happy is.

&#x200B;

A long relationship does not always imply a successful and happy one. And if your relationships are actively making you sad, whats the point of continuing to invest in them?

The same maxim can be applied to every relationship, be it personal or professional.

&#x200B;

\--

\# her

From her perspective, she indeed has the right to choose whats best for her. Just like you do. And forcing someone / convincing someone to do something against their wish doesn't usually make them happy. And you wouldn't be happy if your partner isn't.

&#x200B;

Let her go. I know the next few days will be hard for you. But this too shall pass.

&#x200B;

\--

\# career

Find a job that you do not hate.  Something that you look forward to everyday. Something that does not frustrate and drain you emotionally you every evening.

Don't work only for becoming rich. Work because you like what you do.

First become capable of taking care of people dependent on you and then find a  life-partner who would support you, emotionally, financially, socially if you ever need it.

And don't expect them to do it for free, you should also be capable and willing to be there for them, in their hour of need. 

&#x200B;

After all, whats kind of a partnership would it be if the partners do not support each-eachother?

&#x200B;

FIX YOURSELF first. Otherwise, you will end up with someone as broken as you are. It's going to be a toxic codependent relationship. You have 10-15 years before you can settle. Relax. Breathe. Cry if you feel like, reach out to friends. Then sit alone, think about what things that you can stop doing to make your life better. What things you can do to make your life better. work on those.She's aint nothing but a gold digger. Her sad and poor childhood doesn't give her any right to justify this.

She has her future plans clear. It's good that you're getting to know that she prefers money over the person. Imagine yourself being married to this person and then dealing with all the bullshit she might have thrown at you in the future if you ever went into a financial slump.

You're in the safe zone. Get out and stop chasing her.Well, May be she is selfish or May be she thinks her company isn't good for you anymore so she wants to leave from your life. (May be she is doing this for you & your future???? Doesn't make sense though)

She absolutely does have the right to choose the best life for herself and money is an important reason.

Stop imagining that life is like Bollywood. Just because someone was in a relationship with you, doesn't mean they are evil for breaking off the relationship.

I'm just dumbfounded at the idiots here commenting that she was with you for the money. How exactly do they know that? You were practically kids till before. Now, you're adults and you can't make decisions based on Bollywood stereotypes. Marriage is a big commitment and its entirely understandable that someone would want to not make that commitment for financial reasons. People grow and change. That's a good thing.

You have some very, very unhealthy conceptions of how a relationship is supposed to work. A relationship happens when two people decide to be with each other. That's it. If someone decides they don't want to be in the relationship anymore, that's the end of it. It DOESN'T MATTER if you don't agree with their reason. They chose to end it and that's it. Its over. That's a healthy thing and its better than two people forcing themselves to stay together despite the incompatibility.

Do the mature thing. Wish her well and carry on with your life. You will get into other relationships. All that Bollywood bullshit about how you need to love a single person and stay with them for the rest of their life is exactly that. Bullshit. When you do decide to date again, find someone more compatible.Killer Mike's lyrics may resonate with you. Godspeed! 

""If you chase power you ain't gotta chase women  
So take some advice, take cash over ass  
When you get money you ain't gotta take shit  
So, long as you broke she ain't gotta take dick  
Capiche?""It's gonna hurt but bear with me: She's not yours, it's just your turn.RejoiceYou dodged a bullet bro. Consider yourself lucky. Girls like this usually move up a pecking order, i.e. they will marry you if you're rich enough, then they find someone richer and cheat on you for the money. And there are way too many chads in the world to fulfill that demand. Look at the bright side. You got a job at an age where most of us can only dream. You have an early start and a long way to go. Work hard, make money and work on developing yourself. Eventually you'll find someone who doesn't care about your money. Even if you don't, you'll have enough money to enjoy life exactly the way you want.She was just your starter gf. It's good for you that you learnt a very important lesson at just 22. Now you realize whats important in life right? Now go work on yourself, earn money, learn game and do whatever you want to. 

 Once you have earned enough money and when you feel you are ready for a relationship, start looking for a good girl. And this time choose carefully.

All the very best.She doesn't want you. She wants your money. Stay the fuck out.  
If she will leave you as soon as she find someone richer even after marriage.Don't be poor.Bach gaya tu! 

Jaan khaatithi woh tera!Dump her.Dump that bitchJust let her go. She sounds like a gold digger who only cares about marrying a rich guy and maintaining lavish lifestyle without putting in the work.leave her. Make shit ton of money then get married. Drive back to her place and show off. .I was watching this https://youtu.be/0guLv9AdRlQ2Jane de50 cents - get rich or die trying, bro no girls want to marry a dirt poor guy . Let her go make some money and then get a girl so both of the partners can be happyDodged the bullet.Move on. Find someone else.She's not worth your time. Accept the exit proffered and put a few shots tonight.

Edit: Also ask her, why should you be shouldering the responsibility of luxury in her life. What has she done to achieve this goal of hers?dude you are lucky that she is leaving now . sure you have known her for long but sometimes u gotta let evil people go . she is literally a gold digger if she cant handle 1 year of work dont think she will be work for the next 10 . its better if u leave nowListen mate, your far to young, move and make yourself the number one priority of your life.
You can thank me in five year time..Nothing wrong with wanting a man that can make her life betterjaha dekho vahi koi ladka kisi faltu ladki ke chakkar me pada hua hai   
where is patriarchy when you need it?Lel, Shadi mein zaroor aana 2.0. Ban ja IAS bc.Ditch her. She seems to just think about herself . Not worth your time and effort mate.Move on broda. It's not worth your time or effort. Do your best in your job, rise up and make money more than someone she left you for. You deserve someone far better than this gold digger.


And yeah if she comes back, do not accept. She didn't think about you when leaving you so why should you?She doesn't deserve you. Dump her and move on. You'll be much happier without her toxic presence in your life.ehhhhh who marry at 23 nowadays?

sorry, but you sound like one of those who want to have kid then do nothing and dieOP, hope you got laid with her and went through all this shit.. Think she is like a cum dumpster and move on.Dude show  her a mirror. She wants to marry a rich guy just like that? Either she is extremely beautiful or has something unique to give. Can she and her mother bear the expenses of marriage? Marrying you will assure that she doesn't have to bother about it. In my personal experience if you are in love like literally in love these things can be sorted out. 

I am commenting here just because I had 7 years of relation. Same case like your girl. She was poor but slightly better. Her father was a doctor and died when she was young. Her mother took care of her and had similar case of disrespect from other family members. 

One fine day she cried and said  she is leaving because it's my fault that I get angry on her. In 1 hr she was gone. I had no clue when and where I was angry on her and what I said. It has been 2 years now, she is married to a guy living in US. One of our mutual friend(over a whiskey) told me that she was looking for something better for her future as I was pursuing my masters that  time. She wanted stable life and that's it. 

I was poor but not anymore. She lives in US and doing nothing other than cooking. I have enough money now to go anywhere in the world and that's hard earned. 

Let her go if she wants. Don't stop. Don't run behind her. It's useless.3 hours, 57 replies.

We(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.
We both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.


A brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)


If she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

I asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.

Waise bade zeher din hain tumhara bday bhai sahab! :pI used to hang out with some older kids when I was young(maybe 10-11yrs old). Kids maybe 3-4 yrs older than me. Some of them were rich and we used to gather at his big house. Sometimes we ordered food, watched porn, played games etc. 

Sometimes they used to tickle me and take some of my clothes off in the process. One day this escalated to taking my pants off and groping me there. I escalated it further by coming back the next day. This time I walked into his closet and stole Rs. 1100 (this was in 2006). And walked back home later like nothing happened.

these last 2-3 days I've become such a frustrated hateful bitch due to this fuckin continuous headache I've had the whole time. I had a miniature panic/anxiety attack some days back before puking like I've never puked in my life before, so bad it still hurts. Had an incredibly awful dream/nightmare a day or two before that (full of gore, taboo, sex and all that shit) involving me and my family. Didn't mind it that much then buy it's killing me now. I'm fuckin getting irritated at everything. Felt like murdering a pigeon outside my window this afternoon. Ordered food to feel better, got disgusted half way and threw it away. Tried to watch a movie in the evening, feel like such a chore to open my eyes. Keeping phone on do not disturb all the time because it's getting annoying to read messages. I have to do two video calls every day and I'm irritated right now thinking about it. Tore a t-shirt while washing it today because I had a fuckin bedsheet waiting to be washed. I'm acting normal to people who give a fuck about me but can't help but think that I couldn't care less about it. 

My mood has become so wild that I don't want to talk to anyone because I don't want to think about punching the fuck out of everyone. I've never been like this in my life. I have started noticing migraine flashing lights as well. The anxiety comes like once a year or something but it has completely fucked me up in this lockdown. The worst part is I have no reason to be like this, my life is great with nothing more to ask for. I won't kiel myself or anything, I just wanna fall asleep for like a month or something.

continued from JEE story

There is 20 day gap between JEE and AIEEE. (1st April and 22nd April 2012). Just after the JEE paper, I come home and watch Wrestlemania 28 PPV, which had the el clasico match of the final undertaker vs Shawn Michaels. And I tried my best to forget the JEE paper. I start reading maths the next day.

But 3 days later as I've told in part 1, I'm kinda sure that I've managed to clear JEE by a stroke of ungodly luck, but I'm also sure I won't get a good IIT or stream. But there was also a lingering fear that the model answer key might've messed up and I can't be so sure of passing. It was clear that I need to clear AIEEE with good score to ensure good studies.

I finish a thorough read of maths finally, revise all 3 subjects and then leave for Amravati to give my AIEEE offline paper. I think 2012 was the first year there was an option to appear for the AIEEE paper online, but I didn't choose it to remove any unforeseen variables. I preferred the known devils of bubbling the OCR sheet.

So yeah, my parents and I reach Amravati a day earlier and get to our OYO. I am pretty stressed out, because I had very less hope of getting into a good IIT/stream and this was a make or break moment for me. I revise compendiums all day. When parents left that evening to visit the nearby temple, I quickly browsed all the channels in the room TV. They had ftv!!! So logically I relieved my stress and flushed it. Then went back to my studies. I added this bit because it is so hilarious to me that my parents were praying to god for my exams, and here I am in the room jacking it. Oh well, dopamine was required.

Next day, I reach the exam halls, we get the answer sheets. I am pretty shook and under pressure still. We bubble in the details, and then at 09:00 we open the question paper and start solving. Around half an hour into the paper, the invigilator starts going around the room to check/sign the answer sheet. He sees my paper and starts shouting.

""Are yeh kya kar diya tumne?""

""Kya hua sir?""

""Are bhai roll number to dhang se bubble karte! Galat number bubble kar diya hai tumne! Tumko pata nahi kya overwriting nahi kar sakte! ""

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooof moment

I had misbubbled one digit out of my 8 digit roll number.

Of course I knew overwriting is strictly not allowed. Distributing a new sheet was also strictly not allowed

I ask for a new sheet, he declines. I request him again, he says he needs to ask to the chief invigilator. So he sends someone to call in the chief invigilator.

I am just sitting there heartbroken and angry at myself for a good 3 minutes after all the conversation. This sweet girl that was sitting in front of me had turned around was staring at me for a couple minutes straight. Looking at her finally I come to my senses, I tell her bluntly ""Apna paper likh."" And I continue solving my own paper slowly, because I was simultaneously also regathering my courage and senses.

Chief invigilator just says they will not give me a new sheet. I just say ok. I simply overwrite the roll number - bubbled the correct digit, and just [X] crossed over the incorrect digit. And continued the paper.

I just kept convincing myself that the checking people will have mercy and sense to accept the paper/allot the marks to the correct roll number.

Anyway I keep at my paper, going by my standard order C, P, M. Physics was a curveball. It was either hard or my disturbed mindset just couldn't solve shit at that time. I struggled quite hard and skipped quite a few questions. But it still was too long. I finally had like 40 minutes for the Maths section.

My AIEEE level maths was ok but not great. But I was again struggling at maths, taking too long to solve the questions. I was still solving them though.

But then it happened. Time was up. Out of 30, I could only attempt 18 questions. And from attempt, I mean I only read 18 questions, I solved all the first 18 questions, but couldn't even get around to reading the 19th question. FML.

Well, the exam ends. I know this was a total failure. Even if the checking people understand the roll number situation, and that's a big IF since they score tensof thousands of cards, I've shat on my paper anyway. I solved too few questions in maths, and in too short time. Best case I get 13 correct in maths.

As I leave the hall, I see my classmate and fast friend CDJ coming out of the next hall, just crying laughing. In a total fit of laughter. Obviously I did not want to talk to him.

Then I start my regular trope with my parents, exam went well! No issues, etc etc.

Unlike JEE paper, in the AIEEE paper we were allowed to tick in the correct answer on the question paper itself and take the paper back home.

I tried the remaining 12 questions at home. and I solved every single one of them. And then I thought wtf why did I have to try them now.

Fucking Aakash cunts released the model key 2 days later. I again have to do the thing I dread the most.

I sat down to check the paper. Mother joined in for some reason, I tried to not involve her but she won't listen. She went through my paper and saw I had not ticked anything for the last 12 maths questions. I told her I had no time, the paper was lengthy. She started shouting that I didn't study enough, didn't practice enough, etc etc. I din't tell her about the roll number mishap obviously.

So we start checking, chemistry was ez pz as always, I almost scored a full 120/120 if it weren't for a couple of silly calculation mistakes. Physics was kinda tough, but I still got almost every attempted question correct, but there were like 4-5 questions I did not attempt.

Maths time. I start checking, 1st is correct. 2nd is correct, 3rd is correct, ..... all 18 questions that I had attempted were correct! My mother was in disbelief. I was in shock. Mom and I start celebrating! This was critical for me to edge past the meat of the bell curve. Get a couple wrong and your rank dips by a thousand. (-10)

I check back later for the remaining 12 questions, I got 10 of them correct. I could've fucking destroyed the paper if it weren't for that mishap...

I ask my coaching professors a few days later about that incident and if there's any hope, they tell me a few people mess that up every year, I don't need to worry, 90% chance that they'll make the right call. Sure enough, a few weeks later I got my result and it was the same as I calculated from the Aakash answer key. The checkers made the right call.

So, when I'd finished my meeting with my coaching prof, I ran into CDJ there. I ask him the usual stuff, then I ask why he was laughing so much after the AIEEE exam.

He started laughing again. Then he told me that a peculiar kid sat behind him in the exam hall. Playing on his mobile a few minutes before taking his seat. Clearly he had come Bhagwaan BharoseTM ,you know, he was in the majority of the people who appear to the AIEEE exam just for the sake of it.

Anyway CDJ gives his exam, after the exam the guy behind him asks ""Tum topper ho na? Tumne saare problem itne quickly kar liye.""

CDJ said ""Haha yes. Paper aasan tha.""

The guy starts celebrating with a air fist pump.

He said ""Yes! Yes! Bura mat maanna, par maine tumse saare answers copy kar liye! Thank you bhai.""

CDJ gets annoyed. But still, calms himself (he's one of the most zen people I know) and says ""Tumne kaha se dekha? Mai to question paper poora dhank ke solve karta hu.""

He says""haa but tumhara answer sheet toh kaafi khula pada tha. Dheere dheere poora dikh gaya!""

CDJ says ""Abe apne question paper ka set alag hai!!!!"" There were 4 sets of the paper: A, B, C, D. These 'sets' actually have the same questions overall, only their order is changed. Seating order is according to roll numbers, and the question set allotted alternates every 4 students/2 benches.

Set distribution:

A B

C D

A B

C D .. and so on.

Mar jaunga main.For those of you who are alone in the time of lockdown and is fed up eating cookies and cakes as dessert then I have a recipe of a dessert which is easy to make and is healthy as well.

The dessert is called gurpapri or jaggerypapri(I don't know what papri is called in english ).Here is a photo of it. 

http://imgur.com/a/NlevCMf 

Ingredients : WHEAT FLOUR , JAGGERY, GHEE, a cooking pan, a stove.you must have atleast one medium bowl of flour, jaggery and ghee otherwise its not possible to make. (Medium sized bowl the one in which you eat dal. Bowl can be bigger as well. ) 

Proportions : Take the ingredients in equal proportions(eg 2 bowls wheat flour : 2 bowls jaggery : 2 bowls ghee). These are proportions if you wanna make it the right way. 

But gurpapri is heavy being healthy so if you are on a diet take these proportions(2 bowls wheat flour : 1 bowl jaggery : 1 bowl ghee). 

Steps to make :
Pour flour and ghee in the pan according to your proportions.

The flame must not be high, set the knob to the extreme left where the flame is the lowest. 

Mix or stir it well for next 25 to 30 minutes. (this one is the most difficult step but it will be worth it).

One Imp thing to note is that don't let the mixture stick to the pan. 

After 15 minutes the mixture or dough will start becoming soft as ghee mixes in it. 

After 25 min the colour will change to brownish texture and it will be soft as well(the parle g texture ). 

Now turn off the stove and add jaggery into the mixture immediately. (you can add saunf too if you want)

Now keep mixing till the jaggery softens¬† and mixes well with the dough. 

There you have your gurpapri ready. Take it out in a thali and level it with a bowl. Cut down the pieces as well. When it cools down it is ready to eat.[deleted]I am off to sleep tonight good night people.I will pay INR 500 to get a copy of Roshesh Sarabhai's published poetry book.

Less embarrassing story I've told earlier for today-

Around June 14-15 of 2016, after I'd finished my college, I went for my job interview in Gurgaon. After clearing it, I went back to Roorkee to help my friend (the one I mentioned in the GATE day crying story) to help him prepare for the interview. I stayed with him for 3 days, then I had to go home. I had minor back ache the first day because I'd been carrying my heavy luggage in Gurgaon and Roorkee stations, because I'm a cheapskate that won't hire a porter.

Before going back home, I said I wanted to go to this cheap brothel in Meerut he'd gone to a year earlier. I wanted to lose my virginity in college, and this was one way to achieve that. 250 INR per hooker. (MASSIVE LUL in retrospect, but he really praised the women there). He called his friend and told him the story, and he agreed to take me there, but only if I pay for the whole tour.

We reached the Meerut bus station near the clocktower the next day. I hadn't had lunch or breakfast due to weird timing of the bus. He suggested we walk the rest of the way. I said ok.

I walked almost 2 miles in the peak of Indian summer noon heat. I tried to soldier through it and arrived at the brothel. Every single one looked fucking ugly and miserable. I cursed my friend deeply that moment for having such low standards. But I paid the aunty and we chose our girls, and went to respective rooms.

But we couldn't begin, she tried to put a condom on me but my penis shriveled up irretrievably and just won't obey me. I'm just standing there, jerking it, trying to breathe life into it, but nothing. I figured I should lay down. As soon as my back stretched straight on the whorehouse bed, I knew something's wrong. I immediately realise how feverishly hot my body is, and every single major muscle felt cramped, and how high my heart beat rate was. Pain all over my body, and my back is killing me. I knew I had a terrible sunstroke. Still I being the idiot I am tried to save my money, tried to jerk my dick to life, but of course that was impossible.The girl got annoyed after 10 minutes of watching me fail to get an erection. She laughed and left the room. Then I got dressed and left the brothel with my head low, trying to dodge the whores cackling mocking me.

INR 1500 down the gutter, and sickness and shame on top of it. At least my friend's friend got laid. Tough motherfucker.

edit: we had to give 'bakshees' to each whore for 'muh dikhai', at least 250 rupees. So 250*2 to the aunty, and 250 for bakshees to each girl, plus the bus charges/snacks/medicine for the to and fro journey came out around 1390 something idk, I know 1500 because I'd only taken 3 notes of 500 rupees in my pocket to prevent myself from getting robbed.Final part do mein break kar rha hun

D ek cheez aur btata hai ki woh banda ye aur bola tha ki main aap se milne aaunga dholavira wapas jaane se pehle pkka. 9 baj chuke the jab tak.

Maggi ban jati hai aur hum log complete silence mein use khate hain. (Waise maggi aaj tak nahi khai. Bonefire pe bani maggi mein alag hi smoky flavour aata hai. Yum) Teeno hi iske baare mein soch rhe hote hain. Par koi kuch nahi bolta.

Main Pan saaf kar rha hota hun ki tabhi D bolta hai ki yaar, ganje ke chakkar mein jyada soch gya. Chodo, ye baat. Baat ajeeb lagi isliye tumhe bta di. Par chodo. Raat ko yahin rukenge koi dikkat nahi hai. Mast view hai, maje aayenge aur subah jaldi chalenge yahan se.

Iss baat pe P bhot hi serious ho ke bolta hai ki bhai yahan se chalte hain. Aage kisi homestay mein rukk jayenge. Uss bande ki niyat sahi nahi lagi aur deserted jagah waise hi hai. Toh risk nahi lete hain aur chalte hain. 

Iss pe D bolta hai ki agar use pta hota ki agar P ki itni phat jayegi toh woh hume btata hi nahi. P phir se khta hai ki chalna hi sahi rahega.

Main ab tak kuch nahi bola tha par iss baat pe main bolta hun ki yaar hum kuch jyada hi soch rhe hain. Hum uski baaton mein subtext nikal rahe hain. Aur agar P ko itni hi dikkat hai toh hum ek baar police se baat kar lete hain ki hum aise aise yahan camp kar rhe hain aur puch bhi lenge ki area kitna safe hai. Aur record bhi ho jayega ki haan 3 ladke ruke the yahan kyunki ghar pe waise hi nahi pta tha ki hum Gujarat hain. 

Toh hum police helpline no. pe call karte hain but connect nahi hoti call.
P phir se bolne lagta hai ki chalo. Baar baar bol ke woh humari bbi phaad rha hota hai toh D usko daatne lag jata hain. Thodi derr tak aur aise hi chalta hai.

Last mein hum yeh decide karte hain ki pack karte hain sab kuch aur 1 ghante mein nikalte hain yahan se. Ab tak aag bhuj chuki hoti hai aur hum bilkul andhere mein bethe hote hain.
Main kuch bol hi rha hota hun ki P ek dum se bolta hai ki chup ho. Woh bolta hai ki usne ek gaadi ko aate hue dekha tha dur se aur ab tak car ne hune cross nahi kiya aur raaste mein bhi nahi dikh rhi mtlb car ne lights off kar li.chalo bhai log

Once I was in Dominos in a mall of a Tier 2 City in India. I saw 2 really hot egyptian women. Started talking with them with a ""Hey can have a short talk with you?"" and the sat with them. What a charmers they were. Belly Dancers by passion and I saw them perform later in a video. They were good. Cleopatras in front of me. One of them was such a seductive queen who behaved like a Spy Assassin. Wearing Black leather jacket and round rimmed glasses. She had those A Line Bob short hairstyle which make women look funky. Holy Fuck. She Talked for 15 minutes but led to nothing. She was into me as well. But I had some major defects in me despite the positives.

  


If that day, if I had good muscles, if I had my own house, my own car with a driver and money to fix my physical and mental things, if I had a sarcastic bakchod personality, I would have given a titty fuck to Goddess Cleopatra in my grand Pyramids while she vibrated her ass in belly dance style and screamed ""Merhaba"" after every few seconds.

  


You know what motivates me the most in life towards my goals? - That day of failure with the Cleopatra and the resulting state of sorry for my pathetic financial state.

  


Thats what motivates me.Kaise ho beSo Bernie dropped out eh!Had rabdi today.. courtesy of neighbours, I think they like meAlright everyone.. goodnight and good byeHip hop ke apne top five tracks bataiye jantaStop calling it sex, if you didn't cum inside her.Why do people care about IG followers?

A guy, 20 years older than me, joined my office 3 months ago as my junior. Typical Bengali and orthodox. And also clearly neither that technically sound nor too intelligent otherwise. But a hardworking, well-meaning guy.

I had told him I graduated from an IIT when he asked me about my education.

Welp, he must have observed my behavior for the last 3 months, including all the festivals of last 3 months.

3 days ago he asks me, out of nowhere and no prior conversation that day, ""sfwaccountfw ji, aap naastik hai kya?""

""Hahaha. Aap yeh kyu poonch rahe hai? wo bhi ekdum se.""

""Nahi aap IIT se padhke aaye hain na.""

""Arey yeh to bilkul galat idea hai aapko. IIT me to bahut jyada religious log bhi hai. Maximum log thoda bahut religious to hain hi.""

""Oh accha. Aap bhi asstik hai matlab?""

""Nahi nahi. Main naastik hu. Par aapka IIT wala assumption galat hai.""

Ever since childhood, I have this weird disease of getting late. It has persisted from school to now. I am late very often, at least 4-5 times a month. My father is even worse in this regard, he is almost always late for work. :/

So yeah, back in 2011 one morning I was late for my JEE coaching class in 2nd year. It used to start at 7 am, and I had left for class at 6:50, which was pretty late since coaching was around 9 km away.

So I am speeding down the empty roads like a madman, racing my brand new Pleasure upwards of 70 kmph. u/thisisbhusha, I was driving near the SBI atm of VNIT's main gate (opposite to NPTI) I see a black bull strolling around at a distance, walking towards me. As I am about to cross the bull, he charges for me! Reflexively I quickly glide to my right, just to see a middle aged woman jogging with earphones in her ear crossing the road divider.

Again I reflexively glide towards left, but I cut REALLY close from her, her dupatta slid over my right rear view mirror. I look back to see a horrified woman, totally silent. Understandable, a madman almost clean bowled her at 70-75 kmph speed. BUT, she looks kinda familiar. Could she be? No, no she can't be her. I was driving too fast anyway, it could have been any middle aged woman.

All this happened in the span of like 2 seconds. So after I get a safe distance from the woman, I slow down and take a breather, then drive at slightly above reasonable speed for the rest of the way. I reached coaching 10 minutes late, luckily it was chemistry for the first period and my teacher only a simple question to solve, so no worries, I didn't lose much in those 10 minutes.

2nd period was maths. Madam comes in and starts giving problems, all of which are head scratchers for me. 40-45 minutes into the class, as I was busy attempting another question, she says:

""sfw?""

""yes ma'am?""

""tum ******* park ke paas rehte ho na?""

""yes ma'am""

""VNIT main gate waale raaste se aate ho na yaha?""

Bruh moment

""yes. yes ma'am""

""tum mujhe jaan se kyu maarna chahte ho?""

Entire class is alert now. Everyone is taken aback and now waiting for my response.

""Madam wo bail aa gaya tha saamne...""

""matlab ki kya gaai bail saamne aa jaye to apni maths teacher ko uda dena? huh?""

""sorry ma'am""

""gaadi dheere chalao sfw, time se nikla karo ghar se.""

""yes ma'am. sorry ma'am.""

Entire class is trying to suppress their laughter, everyone is like wtf?

Worst part is that her son also studied with us, and he gave me hell for nearly 'killing' his mother. :/

Time and again my friends reminisce about this event, one guy said ""bhai agar to takra jaata toh kya hota?""

""uska beta maar deta mujhe, aur kya.""

u/holdmybroccoliToh baat december ki hai jab ham teen dost bike ride ke liye gujarat gaye the delhi se. Do bike thi aur dono hi KTM duke 200. Ek main chala rha tha aur mere piche P betha tha. Doosri bike D chala rha tha.

Hum log uss din rann of kutch cross kar ke aa rahe the aur dholaravira ja rhe the. 

Dholavira is a place which during rainy season becomes an island. So only one road connects it to the rest of Gujarat. And the road goes straight for about 5 kms with nothing on both sides, just dry sand.

Toh sunset hone waala tha aur hume apne tent pitch karne ke liye jagah bhi dhondni thi andhera hone se pehle kyunki andhera hone ke baad problem hoti hai kafi tent lagane mein.

Hum uss road pe enter karne hi waale the aur sunet ho rha tha (and by god, aaj tak usse sundar sunset nahi dekha,  kabhi photo share karunga), tabhi hume ek choti si deserted building dikhti hai road se thoda 100 meters hatke.

It turned out to be a 2 storey Forest department watch tower. Aas pas mein sabse uchi jagah woh hi thi bhot dur tak. Toh naturally view bahut acha aa rha tha. So we decide to stay there for the night. And start unloading our tents and other stuff from the bikes.Aage ka chat accha hua, we shared some poetry we used to write and shared few laughs.

I had the weirdest dream last night.

My friend (male) and I were talking in my room. We were feeling very hot and thirsty and uneasy. We were also getting bored. So we got naked and I fucked him in the ass, both standing. For like 30 seconds and then we got bored because we weren't enjoying it. I got off without bothering to finish. We just sat there naked and browsed through youtube.

Then I woke up and realized why I should always drink water before going to sleep.Tere jaise hi mera bhi dil khudgarz sa hai

I always studied with my friend A.R. for the last 2 years of college. He was shrewd, but not that academically good. So I helped him with the concepts and he helped me with my attention span.

Jumping straight to the end, we studied for GATE together. I was not too confident with my studies, and was revising 4 hours before the exam. He was also revising in my room. We were both very sleep deprived.

I suddenly hear him whimper, and I look at him. He was full-on crying! Tears rolling down his cheeks and into the book. I asked him what happened, and he said he doesn't remember anything he's read. I was in a pathetic situation myself, but I was pretty shook seeing my friend so helpless. I tried to cheer him up and just told him to go have a shower and get something to eat.

He cleared the exam barely. We still chuckle about that day.Wait karane ke liye sorry

Hum dekhne lag jate hain tabhi hume car ke engine band hone ki awaaz aati hai road par se. Phir gate khulne aur band hone ki. Aur phir logon ke chalne ki. Ab tak hum teeno khade ho jate hain full ladne ke liye tyaar. D & P waise bhi fighter hain full. Teeno apni apni torch on kar ke aawazon ki taraf point kar dete hain. Hume do log humari taraf aate hue dikhte hain. D bolta hai ye wohi hai. 

Woh abhi thodi dur hota hai ki main jor se bolta hun ki kya kaam hai? Woh bina jawab di aate jaate hain aur bolte hain ki hum toh sirf milne aaye hain. Aur unhone D se bola bhi tha milne aayenge. Abhi bhi hum mein 20 kadam ka gap hota hai.

Itne mein woh humari dono bike dekh leta hain. Abhi tak use nahi pata hota ki do bike hain. Woh apne saath wale ko ishara kar ke bolta hai ki ye hi woh mhngi waali bike hai.

Phir woh aur pass aata hai aur uska chehra dhang se dikhta hai. Aur bhawan kasam, agar kisi ke chehre ko dekh ke koi galat feeling aai ho na, toh woh uske chehre se aai thi. Ek lamba se cut mark hota hai uske cheek pe.
Gand phat chuki hoti hai ab tak

Woh bhot hi pyaar se baat karne lagta hai bilkul bhaiya bhaiya karke aur smile karke. Par uski smile bhi aisi hoti hai ki darr lag jaye ache ache ko. 

Woh humse bolta hai ki aaram se ruko koi dikkat nahi hai. Safe area hai bhot. Koi dikkat nahi hai. Mera no. le lo agar koi dikkat aaye toh phone kar le na. Main subah bhi aap se milne aaunga. Aap raat bhar yahin ruko koi dikkat nahi hai. Aise ek do baar aur bolta hai.
Woh thodi derr tak bolta rhta hai par hum jyada react nahi karte. Apna no. de ke woh chala jata hai. Aur iss baar hum use jaate hue dekhte hain jab tak woh pura road cross nahi kar leta. 

Uske jaate hi iss baar mein bolta hun chalo. Kyunki jis hisaab ke uske kaam the na jaise car ke light off karke aana, aur bikes ki taraf baar baar dekhna woh sahi nahi tha. Aur woh baar baar ye kyun bol rha tha ki aap raat bhar yahin ruko koi dikaat nahi hai. 10 minute ke andar usne ye baat 4 baar boli thi ki aap raat bhar yahin ruko koi dikkat nahi hai.

Iss baar humne deri nahi lagayi. Waise saman load karne mein 20 min lag jate hain par humne 5 minute mein sab kuch pack kiya aur nikal gye dholavira ki taraf. 

Raat ko 12 baje bina ki theekane ke hume wahan se nikalna pada woh bhi aise jagah jahan hotels, dhabe kuch nahin the rukne ke liye. 

Hume nahi pta humne sahi kiya ya nahi, be faltu mein hi darr gye par gand bhot gandi phat gyi thi.
Aaj tak sochte hain ki ho sakta hai uss bande ki niyat sahi ho bas shakal kharab ho?

Par jawab nahi mila hai. Tum log kya karte?Kya hum log mil ke ek roadtrip plan kar sakte hain?

The guy who has sex with his girlfriend is paying for it in the form of the food, liquor and outings he takes the girl to. Costs maybe a few of thousand rupees. 

Maybe the sex between working husband and working wife. They share expenses and live in same house.

Hum kuch derr tak toh 2nd storey pe beth kar sunset dekhte hain aur D & P maal phukte hain. Important point jo baad mein kam aaega: andheere mein road pe aane jaane waali cars ko hum aaram se dekh sakte hain woh bhi kafi dur se hi kyunki road staright hai.

Ab tak acha andheera ho chuka hota hai toh hum khana banane ka decide karte hain. Maggi and other eatables.

Dikkat ye hoti hai ki humare pass paani kam hota hai puri raat ke liye. Toh hum log D ko ek bike aur bottles ke saath paani laane ke liye bhej dete hain aur kuch waise hi khane ka laane ke liye. 2 km pehle hi ek gaav dekha tha humne toh D wahan se paani lane gya hota hai.

Aur iss time mein hum, lakdiyan collect kar lete hain aag ke liye aur thodi bhot waise tyaari kar lete hain.

20 minute baad, hume road par ek single headlight dikhne lag jati hai dur se hai. Bike ki aawaz se pta lag jata hai woh D hai.

D ke aane ke baad hum maagi banane lagte hain aur thoda bhot biscuits wagarah khate hain. D pehle toh thodi der kuch nahi bolta par phir btata hai ki  dukaan par use ek admi mila tha aur woh khe rha tha ki aap teen log ho kya? Woh D se btata hai ki usne road ke kinaare 2 flashlights dekhi thi jab woh watchtower ke pass se nikal rha tha (hum log torch ki light mein lakdi collect kar rhe the). Phir woh D se bike ke baare mein puchne lag jaata hai ki kitne ki hai, badi achi bike hai? D ko lagta hai ki agar 1 lakh ki bolega toh dikkat ho jayegi. Toh woh 50 hazar ki bta deta hai ye soch kar ki normal smajh lega woh. Par woh banda phone pe baat karne lag jata hai local language mein. D ko uski batein smajh mein nahi aati hain bas ye pta lag jata hai ki woh bike ke baare mein bta rha hai kisi aur se aur 50,000 bolta hai ek- do baar. D phir hamse bolta hai ki yaar ajeeb se feel aa rhi thi bhot.Yaar bachpan me mujhe lagta tha ki mai bohot accha insaan hoon, bade hoke pata chala ki mai ek number ka madharchod hoonDoes anyone else here write poems?Ye LNRDT hai ya r/nosleep.u/baingandrift

I saw this real old Muslim man  in Katra asking people who come back from Vaishno Devi trek to get their  legs massaged.

The others masseurs around him all had a customer,  but apparently some Hindu devotees were not willing to get a massage from someone with a skullcap and beard. 

You could tell from their expressions. I was sitting inside a cafe watching this happen.I posted in morning thread that I saw my sisters boobs 

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them . Now whenever I see her I try to look at her boobs. She doesn‚Äôt wear a bra so her nipples are visible.They bounce as well.they have perfect shape and size.i love looking at them.She shows quite a bit of cleavage as well .  When she hugs me she pushes her boobs against me really tightly.i love it

So, I am pretty good at mugging stuff up. I suck at maths, good at physics type studies, but I'm known for my capacity to memorize written stuff. Back in 10th standard, I was infamous for having memorised all maths problems of both textbooks, all english essays (well most part of them) from the navneet book, and yeah everything else you can think of. And from memorised, it was at the level that I knew every single step to every word problem/geometry question. Often I recalled the answer simply by hearing the name of the character in the word problem.

eg: Mother asked me to solve ""Ashok buys 140 shares..."" , I reply ""oh yeah, the answer is 7200."". A 30 HP car runs at 54 kmph - 1492 newton

In SSC board exam, I wrote an expansion of idea for 2 sheets in 6 minutes because I remembered it all.

But I wanna focus on the opposite side of the spectrum. I am infamous for my inability to remember human faces and names since my birth. I am equally horrible at remembering routes and landmarks, but it hasn't caused me much pain yet besides some benign mockery from friends.

I forget people's faces who I'd talked to just hours ago. I can never remember names unless I've talked to them a lot. It is a running joke in my extended family. Ever since birth, my aunts, uncles, and 2nd/3rd cousins ask me ""yaad hai mai kaun hu? Mai teri kya lagti hu, chachi ya bua? achha kaha rehti hu yeh bata de?"" and I always reply that I don't remember anything, then everyone except me laughs. Then I try to remember their face, their names, where they live etc, which I am able to retain for maximum one month, which means I'll face the same mockery the next time there's a family reunion. This started from when I was a kid, and this tradition is very much still alive today. Though since I now live in Vadodara, I am absent in most of the trivial family events.

Basically my life is that Scarlet witch-Thanos meme whenever my extended family is around.

I'm sure this will cause me serious issues in my job, but it hasn't yet.

anyway, the real story I want to tell is short, and it's this:

Back when I was 12, an aunt of mine, who is from both paternal and maternal side (aata saata), got sick. This was during summer vacations, so my mother, my sister and I went to go live with them for around 2 months, so that mother could take care of her in Raipur. The 3 of us always went to go live with our maternal grandparents during summer, but only for like, 3 weeks maximum.

Anyway, summer vacation is about to end so we come back home to Nagpur. Train reaches the station, we get off on the platform. Mother says ""Are Papa bole the platform pe hi milenge. Thoda dhoond to."" Two of us said ok and and ran of eyes over all strangers, and then it hit me.

I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT MY FATHER LOOKED LIKE!

Apparently 2 months of not seeing father was too much for my puny brain. I acted to search for Papa, but I actually was just walking trying to remember what he looked like. I tried to go through any childhood memories, but I just couldn't. Even at the age of 12, I knew this isn't normal. I was ashamed and terrified. I had started to get cold sweats.

Luckily, in like 10 minutes or so, my sister found him. We took an auto, boarded our luggage and followed him back home all cramped up. But I REALLY concentrated on dad's face and body for a few days after that.I'm the most oblivious person..

Here's one of the stories to back that Claim..

So me and my school friend joined the same Univ but different streams and so we had each other's company for chilling and all that. He already knew some girl and she was in the same city..

So we planned an outing where the three of us watched a movie together. After the movie we went to lunch where her 5 other girl friends (she was from womens college and senior to us by two years) and we went to one of the poshest places in the city. Had nice Italian food and later went to a dessert joint. The icing on the cake was I could see a lot of posh cars pass by the window and had one of the best days of my life..

Six years later over drinks my friend told me that he liked that girl and was sort of dating her then and I realised I was third Wheeling..Sleep or not to sleepPoems ki baat nikli hai toh ispe bhi feedback de hi do




Countless times,

I have drowned. 

Slow and silent,

without a sound. 

Crashing against violent waves day after day. 

Swimming towards nothing in this ocean of grey.

With no end in clear sight- Still,

I struggle with this blight- 

Willfully and stupidly.

Hanging on to a foolish possibility.

But alas, even a stupid heart can be salvaged, no matter how broken. 

All it takes is a resonating token.

One that rings true: 

""Don't cross oceans for someone who wouldn't jump a puddle for you.""

Even though I was lost and struggling in this ocean of grey, 

I know that I've never been in a better place.And this, pakka last 



you walk a step, i walk two

go ahead and wait for you

watch you in awe

get lost in this maze

piggy back ride, a mile and craze

'cause walking together 

might be a chase

together is something we both can do 

take a step, i'll wait for you 

walk a step, i'll walk twoBois let's go here

359,hauntin,"I don't understand, what is the SC's role in this? Like, what can SC do about this?Godi media will always capitalize on demonizing the Muslim community. But somewhere, I think the Muslim community needs to step up and accept that what happened was a mistake on part of the Tablighi Jamat.

Instead, the Islamic spokespersons appearing on the news  are aggressively defending the Jamat's asinine attitude. They call for the news to stop demonizing Islam at large but don't realize that the Jamat incident gave Godi media and the bhakts the perfect scapegoat and excuse to continue ostracising Muslims.

Instead of adamantly defending what is universally being considered a dumb move which is going to hurt a LOT of people, and I don't just refer to the Coronavirus, these spokespersons should be mature and just apologize on behalf of the Jamat.

Knowing the history of the Jamat, Godi Media and Bhakts, these factions will never see the bigger picture. Each wants to serve their own ends and feed their own delusions. If the Muslim community truly wants to defeat unwarranted prejudice, they must be more mature and put the community before their beliefs. Things will change for the better eventually, but they need to change themselves first.Instead of going to Supreme court, try to bridge damage done,accept mistake, apologise, come in main stream and show you care for this country and its brothers living in it.

Eat some banana milkshake and dry fruit as your snackYou should check for diabetes, it's a possibility. Also maybe some stomach issues, maybe consult a gastroenterologist.

If there are no such problems,maybe it's just that the food you're eating has a high glycemic index (i.e it has more sugar and carbs) and quickly gets digested leaving you hungry.

It certainly is a huge crisis but it also comes with a few opportunities which the various government departments that are not busy with COVID-19 can handle like the PWD, Roads and Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation, etc.

I think it would be a great time to fix infrastructure in most cities, in buildings that are heavily used throughout the day, in bridges and roads that require critical maintenance and also in heritage sites which are overwhelmed with visitors but need maintenance. The governments should utilize this opportunity to hire laborers and provide them with food and accommodation along with generous rates for the work and ensure proper safety from the corona crisis.

This way when the cities are back up and running, much of those infrastructure projects that forces roads to be closed either totally or partially could be avoided and a lot of the traffic caused by jams can also be avoided.

401,ForTheMoonNeverBeams,"So sorry to hear about your loss, I know how hard it can be.

There was a similar thread a while ago with some really good advice, please do go through it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/evlval/my_father_just_passed_away/The first thing to do would be to get a Death Certificate. A basic guide about getting a Death Certificate : http://lawtimesjournal.in/what-is-the-legal-formality-to-be-carried-out-after-a-person-is-dead/
However I would still suggest you to get the help of a lawyer to decide the next steps regarding the company, any outstanding loans etc.If a person expires, his liabilities will be balanced against his assets. It means his loans will be paid out of his assets, not yours. If you are not inheriting his belongings, you are in no way responsible for any of his loans. If he has loans, contact a lawyer who will approach a court to establish an estate and pay off loans. If the estate or the sum total of his assets is less than the sum total of his loans, the creditors will bear a loss. If the sum total of his assets exceed the sum total of his loans, the balance of the estate or the remainder after his loans are paid off, will be inherited by the heir.

A private limited company lives on regardless of the death of it's directors. Remember, a private limited company has limited liability, hence any credits or loans on the company will be paid out of the company's assets only. There has been a Supreme Court guideline against this however, be sure to consult a lawyer or a CA be clear on this. The closing of a private limited company is a legally complex and time consuming affair. Contact a CA and get the process starts as soon as possible. You will need the consent of all the directors for this.Very Sorry, been through this. More strength to you and your family. Hope this will help

1. Death Certificate (extremely important) you will need to get one certified by your doctor first. Next the certificate/letter from the place where his last rights were done. All this is essential to get the DC from the corporation.
2. check all banks , assets , properties for nomination. Check if your dad made a will. IF this is there it will also have the directives for handling the office, company assets.
3. transferring all the shares, + above in next legal heir/spouse and ensuring nominees in all.
4. Check all investments, usually if there is a joint account holder you will get these details from her/him as they will be able to fetch bank statements. Also if their are documents in the house. LIC and insurance schemes need to be closed .. if you have an agent then he/she will be able help. Else check the procedure on the companys website.

these are trying times, take it slow. However DC is of utmost importance to get done on priority basis. Reach out to lawyer friends, or most probably your dad might have a contact since he owned a firm. Check his visiting cards or recall if he spoke of any lawyer friends. Take support from his CA as wellSorry for your loss. Did he pass away with or without a will? Assuming there is a will and depending on which city you reside you may have to get the will probated from a court. Due to CoVid-19 pandemic, this will take longer than normal.Check whether he has any insurance, if yes that would be helpful in clearing some liabilities if not they will be balanced from his assets. Now if that asset is something like a house land etc and you don't want to lose it then you'll have to clear off the loan.Sorry for your loss.

1. Most important to get is death certificate.

a. You should been given death certificate if you're father passed away in Hospital

b. If in home, you need to get a notary done

c. Cremation certificate - this is also very important and no duplicates will be given.

c. The hospital should voluantarily send DC to the muncipality under which the hospital registered. If not ask them to do it.

d. Once you they do, you need to submit both DC & Cremation certificate along with few forms at the municpality. Wait for 10 to 15 days (could bribe to get even faster), you'll get the certificate approved municipality certificate.

Rest you can read what /user/cncrndctzn2.Sorry for your loss. My dad passed away last month.

This is the time to rely on others around you. Talk to the place he worked at and inform everyone by phone. Make sure his office HR or equivalent department processes the death.

You won't be able to process anything much else right now. The death certificate will take some time to arrive and you need it for most things. If you don't have political clout, you'll probably need to give bribe at the crematorium to get it faster.

Regarding the company, don't try to take the responsibility on yourself. Your only job now is to grieve and be with your family. Trust me, during such times people will step in and help. You will have a tough time for the first set of days. Don't be shy to lean on friends and family.Yes loans become your responsibility.

>Cabin fever refers to the distressing claustrophobic irritability or restlessness experienced when a person, or group, is stuck at an isolated location or in confined quarters for an extended period of time. A person may be referred to as stir-crazy, derived from the use of stir to mean 'prison

Need less to mention people also  act crazy in summer due to heat. 

Please help the people going through the situation.  

People locked down together in a confined space are always violent to each other.

>In epidemiology, a case fatality rate (CFR) ‚Äî sometimes called case fatality risk ‚Äî is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a certain period of time

For such a rapidly spreading disease CFR doesn't show us a good enough picture because most of the people who have diagnosed still haven't completed their course yet. 

So, It seems we'll know the actual fatality rate only after the pandemic is over.

417,curiouspupil,"You are almost 30 years old, which is probably more than 1/3 of your life. Expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. There is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. Also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. In these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain 'pure' or 'sanskari'. And if you think of it, terms like 'honry', 'dirty' will make way to pious usages like 'love making' for describing sex once marriage is done.

Personally, my future partner's past won't affect me as long as it won't cause any problem with our future. I also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. Anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together.Here it goes. 

1. Men who have sex are not pigs. Sex isn't dirty, it's just sex. There's no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. 

2. Sex is not correlated with honour. Looking at women as honourable just because she's never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. 

3. Sex is fun. It's nice. It feels good. There you go. Girls get horny too, you know. It's not just you who's been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. 

4. What bullshit is this partners first and last ? Are y'll objects and properties owning each other ? Sex is just sex, it's fun it's nice. You can compare it to watching movies. The only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. 

And this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life I've been privileged enough to meet some girls I've been able to love. There's no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. People do exist polygamous relationships. Sex is just sex. There's nothing more to it, character, this, that. Nothing. 

5. Why does it mean so much to you ? Maybe you've spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that's not what everyone does. More than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? Why does your morality have to be overriding ? 

Don't blame others for the image of life you've created in your own head. 



Do try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with Sex ? I'll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman's value lies in her vagina. If it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. Why this ?!


If there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who's name the girl won't even remember.Is this still a thing? I did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). Those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. So yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family.I am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.

1. Not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. Even most is generalization.

2. Sex is not at all associated with honour.

3. Sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. For some it is casual and physical. For some it is emotional.

4. Nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.

5.  You are not the only one who thinks like that. If you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. But demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.

6. If previous relationship doesn't bother the current relationship then it shouldn't be a cause of worry. And i am personally fine with that.lmao what the fuck is this postI think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic Indian trope. Fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. It‚Äôs funny. Sounds like an oxymoron. 

Anyway, as to your question. Having a past isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. You had relationships. It doesn‚Äôt make a difference. What matters is what is the current situation. Are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? Maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. Blah blah. These things matter more than sexual past. 

And honestly, look for a person you‚Äôre compatible with. 

Society seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. But it is not so. A girl‚Äôs honor is not in her pants. We all need to understand that. 

If you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship.If you haven't had any relationships, it's perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn't.

I'll be downvoted here, but as long as you're not a hypocrite, you're allowed to have your preferences.

\>When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront

I don't know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don't have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn't. If she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn't want to reveal anything.

Also, from what I've heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn't even if they did have bfs.People have preferences, you have one. If you are not a hypocrite, it's fine. 

Don't ask her on the first meeting. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she's comfortable with you. 

Tell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. She'll reject you if she's had some partners.OP more concerned if you can see the number 90 on your keyboard than being a virgin at 30. So many parentheses those 2 numbers are faded out, no?Speaking for myself, she will be my equal. I'll be okay with her history if she's okay with mine.I had similar thoughts. I was 29 then. Virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from Govt school in a Tier 2 town, not much English skills and an average looking guy. After I got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, I told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an MNC , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. We got engaged and then wedding and after a week I looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. I didnt care much at first. but I asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. I didnt tell her I saw her emails though.  


Fastforward a couple of weeks, I further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old FB chats and I learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. I had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. I confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. Things went only south from here. Because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only ""friendly"" she claimed.  


I still trusted her but things did not end good for us. I could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. But she is smart. It has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. A part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. I still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/Wife? I believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. Sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past. It will destroy everyone's lives.Why does it bother you? If you have a good partner they would be upfront with you about their past, but why do you find the idea of a past uncomfortable?I'm sure the girls you're looking for are out there. People are horny and naturally they're going to at least make out with a cute partner, so it makes perfect sense. Having sex is another story.  Why have you apparently refrained from even kissing a girl? Are you sure you genuinely had chancesCall me an asshole bit is my so has had like 50 relationship I won't call her a slut, but in my mind I'll have 1 thing going on. 


How did this lady fail in so many relationships, idc who you had sex with before me, but when you have so many relationships before me it creates a doubt on whether you're mentally sound or not for me. 


Ps when I say 50 I mean somewhere around that in serious relationships not some highschool romance shit where you have infatuation which ends in a week or couple.My girlfriend (who's my first) has had 2-3 relationships before me. She's my first kiss, my first sex but I ain't hers. She has done things with her exes that we are still to try.

Imagining those things graphically is not only harmful for my mental peace, but also for our relationship. The way I see it is I don't think she'll be my last girlfriend, hence it's perfectly fine if I wasn't her first. I am not really concerned about her past, what she did was upto her. She's human, she can/ should be able to do those things.  What I will be concerned about if she starts to compare our relationship and our intimacy with her past relationships.

Do I feel bad about it, thinking she has done all those things with other men - no, not even an ounce, because I know I am completely comfortable with the fact of doing the same things I do with her, with my future girlfriends. So I draw my parallels from what I would do, or not do.Not in India or Indian, but what my partner did before meeting me is none of my business and I just regard her past as deciding what shaped her into wanting someone like me.Let's face it, your parents will find some poor girl for you, eventually.

I would absolutely love it if we could have an AMA from you a year into your eventual marriage.

I would bet a considerable amount of money that you would be in an unhappy marriage and find some flaw to bitch about even if she satisfied all your criteria.The way I see it, I wasn't part of the partner's life until I became the parter. People grow up in different ways, explore and do different things. I don't get a say in that.  
I don't understand what exactly is bothering you. You say that a parter's past would bother you, but could you explain how or why? Do you assume that partner wouldn't stay loyal to you because they have had parters in the past and so they might have more in the future? Or do you think the partner is your 'property' and that in their whole life they should experience intimacy only with you? Something else?  Not judging, just two things that came to the top of my head when I thought of  reasons.[deleted]Your parents did a real number on you. Did you not even have a tv growing up?


Boss,youre just jealous your wife got laid before you.Doesnt matter if she did or she did not.This insecurity is going to cause a whole lot of problems unrelated to sex. You are not ready for marriage by a long shot. Your life though,do as you will.


More guys like you,more guys like me getting laid with your wifey when shes tired of your insecure ass.lots of replies, thanks :)  
but no answers on the questions section!. I came to realize I might very well be the only(or among very few) one, i.e #1 is true. thats fine.  


a food for thought: I guess more people just see sex as a pleasure and have zero problems with partner's sexual past. might be pro casual sex too. I guess they are fully open minded people.   
okay, how about this, what if your partner wants to experience how a huge cock feels like(or for that fact some other fantasy)? hypothetically, if she were to remain the same with no emotional attachment, would you hook her up with a huge cock? (or whatever the fantasy)  
or how about being a little bit more open minded and try cuckold or wife swaps? a lot of western, open minded people are trying it anyway. If it does not affect current relationship then it isnt something of a bother right!?U might find that type of women in south India.Even if you search whole of your city with a big torch light, you may not find such girl.

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

And no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.","Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/

421,HarshVipra,"Aren't you supposed to ask this question BEFORE you take up the major?What you learn during your course will only be the fundamentals. A lot of information you will have to learn on the job. Many MBAs come out of college with the idea they will be running the company or at least the department, and then have to fall hard to realize they don't know anything. 

Finance is a very large area. During your course you will learn many different subjects, which may include retail banking, corporate banking, trade finance, wealth management and the rest. Where you get your job will determine the softwares that you use. Only suggestion as of now is to make sure that Finance is something you are basically interested in and not going for because it is 'cool'. And if you are interested, do try to study all the subjects in as much detail as possible, leave worrying about the job to later.You can't get objective answers to subjective questions. Best to ask your teachers or seniors.Accounting and Finance are different areas albeit very closely linked. Most places would prefer CAs for their accounting activities since they are specifically trained for it. MBA finance folks are generally more inclined towards Financial Planning and Analysis. In short, CAs are focused on the accounting standards and enduring thst the companies follow them, MBA Fin are more focused on past, current and future cash flows. You can do that by multiple means which doesn't involve memorising accounting standards (there are several GAAP, IndAS, IFRS, etc.). I would suggest you to check out prof. Aswath Damodaran videos (there is a google talk by him and i urge you to check that as it will help woth your queries) to get a flavour of finance first since your questions make me feel that you are confused between accounting and finance.First of all mate, there is a difference between Accounting and Finance. In simple terms, accounting is day to day flow of money in & out. Finance is forward looking. 

Finance is a very broad subject when it comes to what is taught as a major at a b school. 

Broadly there is corporate finance and financial markets. 

Now, the question is what do you want to become? A CFO of a company or a trader in the financial markets. 

Depending on the answer to that question you can pick & choose what topics you should focus on while graduating.The answer to almost all your questions is it depends on where you get a job/what jobs you apply for.

Liberals: Modi destroyed India.

>At the residence of Rajendra Prasad, the president of Constituent Assembly, a sacred fire was lit and a Brahmin priest chanted Vedic mantras. Collins and LaPierre write: ‚ÄúAs the priest repeated his atonal chant, the learned men and women who would shortly become the first ministers of an independent India filed past the fire. A second Brahman sprinkled each with a few drops of water.‚Äù

Where did Nehru come in the picture. His disagreement with Rajendra Prasad over bringing religion into politics is well known.

>After the reconstruction was complete, KM Munshi invited the then President Dr Rajendra Prasad to inauguration of the Somnath temple. Nehru did not like the idea of the president visiting Somnath temple for inauguration in 1951.

>Nehru wrote a letter to Rajendra Prasad expressing his views on the matter. ""I confess that I do not like the idea of your associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath Temple. This is not merely visiting a temple, which can certainly be done by you or anyone else but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications,"" Nehru has been quoted in various reports as having wrote in his letter.

>However, Rajendra Prasad disregarded Nehru's objections and decided to attend the ceremony in May, 1951. Prasad's decision to attend the religious function at the Somnath temple as head of the state was also criticised by communist leaders.

>Rajendra Prasad, on the other hand, responded by stating, ""I would do the same with a mosque or a church if I were invited...This is the core of Indian secularism. Our state is neither irreligious nor anti-religious.""

A temple?The author is not criticizing Nehru, he's criticizing all Indians for being superstitious backwater bumpkins and bending over for Brahmanical hegemony.

But what Modi did was still stupid and selfish.I don't know what has happened to Shekhar Gupta, the founder and the current editor-in-chief of The Print. He seemed like a well rounded fellow and I enjoyed his Walk The Talk in NDTV. Nowadays, all he does is sing peans for the BJP or the RSS.Oh my God! Is Nehru back from the dead? Haven't been watching zee news or republic tvBc nehru PM hai kya abhi?

The moment someone criticizes Modi, all the bhakts start quoting history as if that justifies his actions.

Nehru ne puja ki ya namaaz ki, uski present times mein kya relevance hai.It's not news that all Indian PMs, presidents and politicians have been religious and ritualistic. The difference is in degree and spread. What's new now in this decade is that they officially promote and spread it through both official policies as well as propaganda. International ""science"" congresses promoting crap like modi gravitational waves, some honcho of IMA promoting some quackery, Ayush minister claiming cures. The trend is taking society in the wrong direction and deserves criticism regardless of what's happened historically.Print has been bought by ambani-adani cabbal or something? They're become increasingly sanghiWhat happened to the print man? They‚Äôve been publishing such non sensical bullshit lately and Gupta Ji is acting more and more sanghi lately.Pandemic and Independence day, great comparison. Both are same and equally  dangerous according to authorRight, liberals should also recall Chandragupta Maurya's puias before blaming Modi.So we are bringing Twitter 'libtard-bhakt' fight to mainstream media now? Lol, that's why I hate every media from Quint to Opindia. They are cheap and crap and focus on bullshit.[Jawahar Lal Nehru - Builder of modern science and promoter of scientific temper](http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article4588.html)I wasn't born, if I were..I would have criticised surely. Now either build a time machine or stop with the whataboutery.Off late I see a lot of irrational discussion on this sub Reddit. Looks like there is an effort and infiltration here too. And why do we keep going back 70 years to justify today‚Äôs dumb acts. And even if there were retrograde steps back then, aren‚Äôt we supposed to leave them behind and move forward. What an idiotic justification is this all.I wasn't born in fucking 1829 or whatever so I don't give two shits about what nehru did and didn't do. I care about what is happening now.There is no harm in doing pujas or prayers .The lighting of diyas , candles , was a good PR move as well as brought together people.However , given the fiasco the first time round , Modi should have stressed that people MUST REMAIN INDOORS .Then maybe  the organisers of these ridiculous marches would behave.All those participatong were inviting the carona virus into their homes.Nehru 1947

Its the scale and proportionality. All poliiticians have to indulge ina a certain level of theatrics., That includes some corny slogans, praises of own country, harking back to old traditions and wonderful culture and so on. In a democracy, a politician has to appeal to everyone.

But when you go after symbolism, rituals, saying and doing things that encourage superstition and unscientific temper again and again, consistently over time, that either means you are willing to encourage the worst - and not just pay the minimum required lip service that democracies compel you.

If it is okay by you, please do share how you built it. Would be of great help to people learning to build such Extentions.From my initial observation, I think this is similar to how Inshorts work.Thanks for making this.

Does this not work on Chrome mobile? Tried it in Kiwi Browser on an NDTv article and it didn't show any summary.For an extension that READs and modifies users' web traffic, I was unable to find your privacy policy. Given you have priced it free, we would like to know how your company makes money and whether or how our user data figures in that.

The fact you're not upfront about user data (how the data is used and who has access to it) shows our privacy is not a priority for you and that's concerning.Should include Swarajya as well..",1586320955.0,fwzwoz,Science/Technology,13,/r/india/comments/fwzwoz/i_created_a_free_chrome_extension_to_summarize/,24,"I created this extension which summarizes news articles and puts it below the headline in near realtime using deep learning.

I wanted to ask an important question, which no one seems to be asking. If you have basic economics knowledge, you‚Äôd know every country has a reserve fund. I remember a RTI disclosed sometime back that India has none.

Where is it? Why is the government instead of giving financial support to people, asking for donations in the PM cares fund?

Almost every country‚Äôs government is giving money to people. In Canada, people are getting $2,000 per month. US employment pays out $1,200 per month. Same in EU..

Considering our PM and FM have been boasting so much about India being financially stable, where is the stability?

And please, if you are going to reply about the relief package announcement by Modi, don‚Äôt bother. That fund has not been deployed and has not reached the concerned people.

I have seen doctors wear raincoats who are working in the front line.

>Firozabad police : You are spreading false news. No stones were pelted on medical team or  ambulance in Firozabad. Please delete your tweet.Most media in the country had a collective orgasm the day the Tablighi news broke. They finally managed to go back to their communal venom in these Covid-19 times. Finally, they were free to be irresponsible once again, and they are trying to make the most of it.

EDIT: Kudos to the UP police, though, for doing this clarification. But I wonder if these rectification and the following deletion of the tweet by the Zee morons will be seen as widely as the original tweet itself.Good on Firozabad Police to come out and make things clear.

Can you also share the link to the tweet please? Thanks.This happens when media reports WhatsApp forwards as news.If corona doesn't kill us, bloody indian media will.

Sure some Tablighi jamat members were fools and anger against that small number is justified but demonising whole community, esp. large section of indian muslims, who has nothing to do with this, for mistake of handful of jamaatees is simply sinister  and malicious.FIR needs to be filed.When yogi's hindutva militia has to fact check hindutva propaganda, you know shit's really hit the fan.why doesnt police takes action against these news outlets, like fir or something, instead of doing a keyboard war?

like this is legitimate fake news, they are basically committing crime, and at most police is doing is reply to their tweets? If it was some poor guy out to buy medicine, he would have been lynched by police without hearing him outpoor guys . get virus. and being accused of getting it deliberately. On a human level I feel so sorry for their plight. Cannot blame them for being devoted followers as that isnt frowned upon in society.

met a lot of fanatics in my time, but usually yhey were the fringe nutcases and not really religious. They viewed religion more as a power game.Since media is largely controlled by BJP. We can safely say and should say, BJP is trying to foment a riot.And most sad thing is damage is already done even it's fake as people locally around me already cursing muslims for spreading of corona and wishes for their death,  not to mention all due to recently fake videos of licking plate and stuff.
Including my parents even after showing them proof, it's like modi has literally brainwashed certain sections of society who believe tv news blindly.
This country is fucked.Twitter is one of the most toxic platform with many trolls and bots than real audience.chee newsZee news, republic, India tv and aajtak are just ridiculously inciting people. Government is least bothered because they win elections due to communal violence and hate politics.Never thought I'd say this but well done UP police, for behaving sanely in these utterly insane times.Zee News - Spreading hatred and lies since forever! There aren‚Äôt a legit news source üëéüèªNow someone will be transferred from the Firozabad police department.**Prayagraj Police: (to Deepak Chaurasia)** A total of 8 people named FIR 127/2020 registered at police station Karalee have been detained. The deceased and the unidentified parties are residents of the neighborhood, the fact that neither of them has any relation with the tabligi group has come to light. On the basis of deliberations, strict legal action is being ensured.

**Firozabad Police: (to ZEENews)** You're spreading misinformation because there's has been no stone pelting on any ambulance or medical team. You should delete your tweet asap.

**Saharanpur Police(to News1 India):** The news you're spreading about jamatis asking for non-veg and peeing in the open is completely false. We personally sent a team to enquire into this and turned out to be completely false.The situation of fake news is really bad. You guys would remember the video of a Muslim guy putting his saliva on oranges. That video was not related to the Corona incident. But the people from my society has now stopped buying anything from Muslim vegetable/fruit sellers. Before buying anything, they are asking the Aadhar card from these guys. 

I think they have finally won and we have lost.Does this come under the purview of ""Disaster Management Act""?Some of the govt owned paid journalists are-
Sudhir choudhary
Arnab goswami
Amish devgan
Rubika liyaquat
Anjana om kashyap
They taught us everyone has a price tag on their forehead. 
Shocked to see that these are the most seen faces of media.
India urgently need journalists who are not afraid of power and money. And should have dignity and self respect.
What are ur reviewsMy father retired a few months back and all he does everyday is watch Zee News. Same for my mother. It's like watching an addict. Breaks my heart.r/convenientcopYou know you‚Äôre scum when even police in UP seem like the good guys compared to you.Why no sedition charges? Shouldn't media houses be held to a higher standard than some random citizen?

Who am I kidding?You see the real face of the people at times like this.
Media just looks for propaganda and if they don't find any, they try to create a fake one which could result in a catastrophe. Shame on Indian Media, and the government too.Shame on the entire Zee group. All their outlets spread propaganda.Instead of asking them to delete the tweet a strict action should be taken against them for spreading fake news. 

Why only common people are arrested for such actions?Only delete and no FIR? Guess The Wire spits out some raw facts against the regime.So no action against Zee nees but FIR against a doctor for asking help. Way to go!That's how they get TRP. This TRP thing has just sold our media. It's way a long time watching proper news. Just controversy everywhere. And our Govt is Silent!!Why medias try to show these type of pictures/news again and again?This is actually govt owned media. This is for vote bank. But now it should be controlled as situations are getting worse. Strict action should be taken against these media. And there face shiuld nit be seen on television againThank you. If there's one positive thing from COVID-19 which is good for India, it is this one. Police verifying the tweet and monitoring out of control media. Hopefully, they carry this post-corona, if ever such time comes.What do you do when the media organizations that report factual news end up cooking up stories. Fuck you zee news.BC FIR file karo Zee News parOne guy sarcastically put patel statue on sale in olx.
Police: Arrested and filed FIR.

Zee news spreading fake news and hatred through social media.

I don't see any FIR? Guess the law doesn't apply to Narendra's sycophantsI dont care what the media or the govt says... but what hurts is going on twitter and looking at how fellow citizens have started treating us.Some of these media persons are acting like terrorists. I hope they will be treated like terrorists after the fall of this regime for trying to destroy India.

Has action been taken on this?I am a Muslim and i just want to know when will this end. I really dont care about the religion. I just want to live, earn a living, raise my kids, take care of my family and die peacefully. Its so wrong to all this shit to a group of people because of their religion/caste/race/language. Punish the terrorists, extremists and whoever is a threat to our country but leave the normal ones alone.Wonder why no FIR?[deleted]Yes this is too much every news channel is just focusing on the stone pelting, inhumane behaviour of people from jamaat under quarantine.
And if that was not enough now they are creating fake news to stir the whole Muslim community.
Rather the focus of News channels should be telling people about Jamaat, how and why it was formed, it's activities in other nations, it's links or how it's the father to many Muslim terrorist organisation or terrorist organisation as most active and devastating once are muslim only.
Its role in Europe, it's major funding, links with Saudi Arabia.
How they are related to Major wanted terrorists of India.
How many Cases of CoV-2 is from the people of Tablighi Jamaat or indirectly related to them, like the one in Dharavi or in Jharkhand.
There is enough for them but Indian media as always never has the balls for the right.

Now the plan is expiring on the 10th and he claims there is at least Rs. 400 left to be used. According to the SMS he received, his services will stop if he does not recharge. Note: they do not specify what services will stop after the plan expires.

I'm confused because this is a local number and I thought the IR pack I used was just to charge his phone with IR facilitates. So because now that he is back in India, I thought that even if that expires, his number and the local services it comes with should still work...right?

Side note (which I am not sure is relevant): When he went abroad, even though his number was charged, IR facilities were not working and a customer care person explained that he would have to charge his number with some other plan of Rs. 400-500 to get the pack to work. I'm not sure if this is how IR really works.

Can someone explain what exactly will happen if he does not recharge? Is it that all services will stop entirely, or only IR facilities?

455,cncrndctzn2,"This is kind of like how middle-class families bring up their children. Extremely strict rules,  high expectations, and harsh punishment  - but few resources to reward kids for following rules and expectations. XDSo... To a dumb reader, is this good or bad?Relating to fiscal stimulus part: With the fiscal deficit we already have I doubt our RBI money printer got enough ink to go BRRRR. More importantly I would prefer direct cash assistance to the vulnerable groups as a part of stimulus if any rather than saving our big corporates whose debt is already constipated in our Banks' anus as NPAThink it's still a bit premature. The announced fiscal stimulus is likely to be just part of the overall package. 

Our power hungry politicians will make sure they spend all the countries money on increasing their powerbase once the lockdown is lifted.I was thinking about it quite a bit and my thoughts first of all are -

A) As a growingly educated and constantly informed country, we see people of all different levels of education and standards. I almost feel that we have misplaced standards. Are we truly at a point to compare ourselves with the developed (1st world), about to develop (2nd world) countries? Why are we not looking at Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa for comparison? Why do we look at economies on an aggregate level and not at a per capita level? After all, the stimulus is going to drive value at the per capital level first (micro economic) before it does anything macroeconomically 

B) Seriously, a lot of these countries have currencies that are the reserve currencies. Usually, these currencies are backed by solid fiscal and monetary policies. These are the currencies that are safe havens. If a country like India spends any further on social welfare, the deficit and therefore devaluation of rupee is pretty much a done deal.

C) Now, not spending the money is also a double whammy. A perfect Keynesian economic storm. Less spending, cut in corporate expenditures, cut in jobs and further less spending and overall shrinkage of economies. Therefore, stringency has to be replaced with prudence and this is exactly where you‚Äôd need the finance minister and the RBI governor coming together and becoming true heroes.

D) Keep economy aside, you absolutely need to find ways to ensure that the poor do not become too desperate. The signs of desperation will result in further spread, further law and order situations and overall class divide. This again requires efficiency and effectiveness at the federal and state levels to ensure welfare reaches to the right sections of demographicsDemo saga all over again, by the time we assess the impact, Mudi Kaka would win in 2024 while our opposition does jackshit to explain the public what happened to them.South Korea in middle? I thought they had one of the strictest lockdown measures.Rant incoming.

Just for perspective, India's economy is now the 5th largest in the world. You can guess who the top 4 are, but the UK and France are now just below us. Let that sink in.

Forget macro or even micro economics, which is mostly what [the Economist article where this graph is from](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/03/emerging-market-lockdowns-match-rich-world-ones-the-handouts-do-not) addresses. 

Think Nano. Urban nano. Or hyper-local urban nano.

The price of life is ""cheap"" here. Inspite of being a mostly young society, we've implicitly decided for example, that the lives of delivery folks (more or less our age) are worth much less that our own.

Never mind their meagre salaries, or that they're starving themselves. Never mind that many of us have not much more money either, but we can always rely on the Bank of Mom & Dad. We always did, and if we didn't before, we certainly will now. They're already concerned about our well-being as is. We're doing what though? Sitting in the comfort of our own homes playing games online or binge watching our shows or whatever; that has implicitly more value than learning how to cook or even making the effort of going down the road to the grocery store. If someone gets beaten, let it be the delivery person. If someone gets infected, let it be them. We're safe. 

This is apart from issues of communal strife, or us not paying our help their fare wages, or the fact that a bunch of us can't be bothered to vote. I could go on.

So let's get to the point. Last night, around 11:22 pm my brother's boss called him and told him that  he has to go to work from tomorrow (which is today) for 4 days because of some production that is on hold for the lockdown. When my brother said he cannot go because he has a daughter and don't want to get her infected through him. His boss told him that he has to go to work otherwise he will lose his job. Boss said that he is going to send a car for him(don't think my brother is on a high rank) . But ,he wont be alone. Five of his co workers were also ordered to go to work. So, the six of them will go in a car in which way the practice of social distancing is not happening. 

My brother with a fear in his heart , went to work today at 8:30 am . The reason he decided to go to work is because he has EMIs of two phones pending and a debt from his friend to clear(his friend being generous told him to give back the money after this lockdown).

Instead of this we can just ramp up production and sell them to needed countries.Told my Bhakt neighbour this, he said daro mat beta Trump kya kar lega, nuclear hai hamare pass.

Thank you, sir. Are you worried about **retaliation to your decision** to ban export of medical goods, like Indian Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs decision to not export hydroxychloroquine to the United States and other country?

&#x200B;

Donald Trump: (34:36)

I don‚Äôt like that decision. I didn‚Äôt hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries. I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk and we‚Äôll see whether or not that is. I would be surprised if he would because India does very well with the United States. For many years they‚Äôve been taken advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that were his decision. He‚Äôd have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said, we‚Äôd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn‚Äôt allow it to come out, that would be okay. **But of course there may be retaliation. Why wouldn‚Äôt there be? Yeah.**Modi did right thing or Trump would have changed us from Developed Country to Developing again.

The green light indicating ""link"" on my modem frequently turns red, but turns back to green if we switch off the modem and switch it back on after 5 minutes. Twice a week the light turns off altogether and we have to take the machine to the exchange the next day where they ""reconfigure"" it. BSNL is massively understaffed, and most of the technology they use is outdated by at least 10 years. If you use the same wires that you did when people used dial-up connections, internet connectivity will obviously be shit. But BSNL employees get paid a big fat govt salary just to sit on their asses. They don't care.Our BSNL landline is dead for 3 months now. I have emailed appellate authority and also Delhi head office. No one is looking into the issue.

I know it's because of the overload in internet traffic due to the nationwide lockdown, and I'm not complaining about that. I use a 2.4 GHz router, it's practically ancient at this point, but I never really felt the need to change, and I'm regretting that decision now. The speeds had gotten really slow lately and I was getting disconnected every five minutes.

But then, all of a sudden, the internet went out. Poof. Gone. There was a solid red light in my router, instead of green. Then it would switch back and forth between a red light and no light at all. I figured it was because I hadn't paid my bills for March owing to the COVID-19 scare, it sorta slipped my mind. So two days back, I paid my bills via Amazon, for BOTH March and April altogether, and the Internet still hasn't returned. I tried tweaking around with the DNS settings, resetting my router, checking the ADSL splitter and cables, so far, nothing's worked. I tried calling the BSNL Broadband Customer Service . No one's picked up. Even though I've heard that telecom companies are supposed to stay open amidst the lockdown.

I'm seriously pissed at BSNL right now. I've had to use mobile hotspots these past few days, and its really inconvenient.

Living in Silchar, Assam, I don't really have much choice with high-speed FITH connections, (aside from JioFiber, I guess?), and I've got a soft spot for BSNL too, but this is getting on my nerves. Either give me my Internet back, or give me my money back.

How people are getting arrested for spreading fake news in WhatsApp groups?
Afaik, WhatsApp chats are based on E2E encryption due to which no one else can see our messages not even WhatsApp employees. So, how are they arresting people?Whatsapp is garbage messenger, Important people don't use this app.  Everybody keep whatsapp because everybody is on whatsapp, working people who require frequent messaging don't use it due to group mess.

Whats app seriously need to provide following features before working people start using it.

1. Separate TABS for Groups. People receive thousands of messages from groups and often important one to one messages are missed due to this. Many people often do not respond or response very late because this miss one to one chat's due to large number group messages.
2. Admin ability to control messages in group. Admin ability to delete any messages in group.
3. Mute people in group. Often time particular aunties / uncles / few people keep spamming in groups.  Its very annoying reading same kind of messages from these people. We have aunty who keep forwarding political messages, one who keep posting environment messages, one who keep forwarding devotional messages and hence important messages are lost.  If we can just mute these people in groups, it will be amazing and will saves years of time for every one.
4. Some focking display profile privacy, not everybody wants to show their profile picture to delivery boys, vegetable vendors and god knows who is in the contact list.  WhatsApp Display Profile have no privacy features.

Edit:

With regard to the question of the concurrence of the Chief Justice, it seems to me that those who advocate that proposition seem to rely implicitly both on the impartiality of the Chief Justice and the soundness of his judgment. I personally feel no doubt that the Chief Justice is a very eminent, person. But after all the Chief Justice is a man with all the failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common people have; and I think, to allow the Chief Justice practically a veto upon the appointment of judges is really to transfer the authority to the Chief Justice which we are not prepared to veto is the President or the Government of the day. I therefore, think that is also a dangerous proposition.

There is nothing conventional that will help you.You would be surprised at the number of people in my family who‚Äôve casually mentioned shooting them down in the past week. I‚Äôm the only person against authoritarianism in my family, everybody else seems to support it even NRI uncles who are minorities where they live. All my friends are sanghis too, two of my best friends (like top 5) have turned out to be xenophobic bigots, vocal islamophobes and RSS sympathisers. 

For the fascists, it does not matter wether or not there is a minority because if there isn‚Äôt a minority, they will create one. If there were no muslims in India, would everyone be Hindu? No. They‚Äôd be Brahmins, Dalits and women. Perhaps once people start looking beyond their privileges and start hearing beyond our fascist enabling airwaves maybe a bulb will light up at the end of the tunnel. 

Our own households are xenophobic, patriarchal and misogynistic. It can be easy to loose hope every now and then. However, it is essential that we keeping forward even if only by a little bit, everyday. Each person that switches over from zee news to ndtv is a step in the right direction. I‚Äôm not saying NDTV is perfect but it is a step in the right direction. 

While you try and tackle these issues in your own home, take care of your mental health, this is exhausting and tough so don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Keep talking with your parents but talk, don‚Äôt mock.It's not just your dad, a lot of people share the same ideology. You can't really do anything about it; just let it be.

Start with small doses.

It will take a month for effects to show.
For extreme cases, it might take 3 months to get rid of the disease. 

This disease is more dangerous to India in the long term.What's the caste of your family? If you're OBC, you can play the same game of High Caste vs Low Caste, as said in manusmriti. Not following manusmriti is going against Hinduism and Modiji. 
Ask you father to pay more respect to his high caste friends.Lots of replies here mentioning you should evade or ignore. Wrong. You should clearly let him know how you detest his views without detesting him personally. This is the first step towards liberalism. Attack the idea, not the man. At the same time, don't hold back from defending your ideas just because people you like may not agree with themWhat you can do in my humble opinion, is try to show examples from history or even in modern day - where people have been seduced into accepting an authoritarian strongman in the promise of a strong economy or stability (even if it means at the cost of hurting minorities). What we have observed is that these kind of authoritarians aren't able to kickstart the economy in the way they promise.

Look at Russia with Putin, Hungary with Viktor Orban, Brazil with Bolsonaro.

Yoj could also make the economic argument that persecuting minorities makes the country unfavorable to investment, to businesses and for the economy in general. Conflict and social tension decreases cohesiveness and in turn increases the probability of a tail risk.

Take for example the protests in delhi, for the large majority of hindus, they aren't probably affected themselves, but the protests have cemented a reputation of India turning into a hostile state for minorities globally.

There's no point arguing over morality with people who have already given in to the dark side, if you want to change their opinions you have to be pragmatic and argue from the focus that personally affects them. Persecution of minorities doesn't affect them directly and thus they don't care, or they might even personally condone it. But showing how such acts can negatively affect themselves can change their position to a more moderate stance from their current veering towards extremist ideology.I'm in the same situation as OP.  My dad was never religious, he had many muslim friends but, now he has started making hateful comments. I tried to reason with him but he made an argument that because he is in the country, he knows better.

I hate that the pandemic is being communalised in India and I cannot let him have his beliefs when, his beliefs are based on whatsapp news and TRP hungry, propaganda pushing media channels. 
 
Now, I listen to the anti muslim news he has ( like I'm genuinely interested to know), I then share fact checked articles on it and complain about shitty media.You don't deal with them. You form your own opinions and let them have theirs.Hey, my mother too asked if they could just kill everyone from the Tabhligi Jamat too. Same WhatsApp forwards i guessThere can be situations where the judicial process needs to be expedited. If you have an organized large effort to endanger Billions of people during an worldwide emergency, swift action might need to be taken that circumvents lengthy process. 
Regardless, I advise you not to run around doing sub-human shit in your host country. Stay safeOther than casually mentioning stuffs and reasoning without arguing, you basically give them an opportunity to side towards being logical. On the other hand, trying to brute force into convincing them is just going to make their thoughts stronger. Better let them be what they are.> a suppressed population like in China,

Why do you think China has a suppressed population, compared to India? Nobody is being lynched for eating beef, having the wrong last name/occupation, etc.. China, like India, sends thousands of students each year to study in North America and Europe. An increasingly large number of these students give up the opportunity to migrant and go back to China, far more than Indian students. Why will so many Chinese people voluntarily return to being suppressed? 

Is China authoritarian? The West likes to think so, but do the West apply the same standard to themselves?  Take the pandemic for example. In the beginning, when the pandemic was localized in China, the Americans and Europeans all criticized China's quarantine is against human rights. Now look at Italy, Spain, and France, all of whom have adopted many of China's methods when the virus hit their shores.  Aren't these countries just as authoritarian?It's not easy dealing with parents with such authoritarian views, as on the one hand you respect and love them, while on the other you hate their bias and views.

I have found that asking questions, constantly, helps slightly. For every statement like 'these people should be shot' or 'this community is dirty' etc., Just ask them why they think so, what made them form this opinion, have they experienced any issues personally? Make them explain. That way, you get a slightly better perspective on why they're authoritarian, and you can better equip yourself with facts and data to counter them.

As someone mentioned, make it personal, like you did when asking them if they'd be okay if same things were to happen to you. 

Directly arguing or countering would make them defensive, people hate being proven wrong. Making someone explain their thought process and reasoning behind their beliefs has a small chance that they'll see your point of view too.Talk to him about the hypocrisy of how the gatherings of ramnavami were ignored.

He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things.

Other than Trump selling it as one.. Wtf is going on here.The bigger question here is why are we using a drug used to treat malaria as a possible cure for COVID19? Drugs used to treat malaria have severe side effects. I am not kidding. 

I had taken some when there was an epidemic of malaria cases in Kolkata in the 90s. But it turns out I had jaundice instead. The side effect was for one full day my neck got bent. I kid you not, I couldn't straighten my neck until I took some other tablet that rectified it. Side effects also include tongue coming out of your mouth for some people.

I don't know if it was Hydroxychloroquine or not but I would be more worried about the side effects of this rather than a possible cure for covid19.India should bring back all its H1B'ers from the US if Trump retaliatesI thought Modi had already approved this. No?Ab ki bar 'Trump' sarkar

Hindus take it up several notches because we throw in our glorious caste system in the mix, along with government sponsored pseudo science departments, propaganda arms in traditional print and digital media, a grassroots and very well organized and funded RSS, a very savvy IT cell etc. 


Every single psychological technique is effectively used by the snake charmer in chief and his slimy goons for thoroughly brainwashing and radicalising the same country which elected Manmohan Singh - TWICE. 


If I turn off the empathetic part of my brain, I would see this tea selling conman as a tremendous opportunity to learn about the psyche of Indian people by clinically studying all the little tricks he and his team uses to make Indians vote against their self interest and then use some of those to survive in this God for saken shithole. 


But, it is hard to turn that off and become a psychopath. I am slowly becoming disengaged with  the plights of the country though. It's just too depressing to constantly pay attention to the plights of the people suffering because of the crime of being born in this country.

Dissenters would be fewer and fewer, and would get harsher and harsher treatment from the government with enthusiastic support of the public. Justice would nowhere be found.

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It‚Äôs almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them.

502,Smooth_Guidance,"its a very complicated scenario tbh. on the one hand, as you said, we havent done enough testing compared to other countries and considering our population we should be testing 5x more aggressively. so yes, lockdown needs extension. on the other hand, considering economy, the livelihood of daily wage workers, agricultural sector, and also the impact of lockdown on mental health i think it should be lifted. im pretty sure the decision makers are facing similar dilemma.I'd say 1) Ramp up testing rates 2) Ensure everyone has masks to wear 3) Revoke lockdown in phasesI feel like places will be more highly crowded than usual with people who are desperate to go out.

I think we‚Äôll all be waking up to a new reality after this lockdown is lifted.  I feel many more people will continue to get infected and die.# NO

wait, lockdown? The one we break every Sunday?Lockdown without a comprehensive testing strategy and a phased release would be ineffective and perpetual.we have actually wasted these 14 days by not testing enough. should have tested around 5 L people by now. The extension of lockdown is necessary now.No. If it's really required, we should open up cities and districts (for travel inside these zones) with no cases, but people should not be able to enter or leave these zones.In my area I know families which are really struggling to accumulate money for upcoming months.
They have issues like money to pay for childrens school, they are not earring anything right now how they are going to sustain any expenditure in future months. 
Those families somehow managing their food with government support and relatives debt but man believe me situation is do or die for them...
They need a way to earn money, so in that sense lockdown should be uplifted.

At least for them...The real number of cases in India is at least 10 times the official number of cases. We know that a majority of novel Coronavirus cases are asymptomatic, i.e. no cough and cold, no fever, no breathing distress. Among the 20%-25% cases which are symptomatic, very few have symptoms severe enough to warrant a visit to the hospital (let's say 10% of the real number of infected cases, I don't have any stats to back up this number, I just pulled it out of thin air), and only 2%-3% will die. 

Conversations with doctors (and their FB posts) in many rural districts of my home state (WB) have shown me that the situation is dire. Doctors and nurses finally have enough PPE, but the overwhelming number of cases has totally destroyed the brittle public health infrastructure. Most patients with COVID-19 symptoms are just getting pneumonia and malaria medicines, and are being sent home, because there aren't enough testing kits, and not nearly enough beds.

Make no mistake, the real, actual number of people infected in India could well be past 1 crore at this point, and we still wouldn't know unless the govt AGGRESSIVELY ramps up testing. In such a situation, where so many migrant workers who've returned to their villages as asymptomatic carriers, in addition to people who've attended various religious gatherings, the national lockdown doesn't really matter. It won't stop the spread any further. It is over, coronavirus has won, and a population roughly the size of Dharavi is expendable.Well. I'd like to be out and about again but its very difficult for me to decide. I'd like things to be normal but we have a pathetic medical system and we wont be able to control the spread of the virus if we do. On the other hand we have so many people that live hand to mouth that have lost their daily income. There seems to be no reasonable answer hereTricky situation. Economy needs some revival.

* India‚Äôs current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we‚Äôre on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it‚Äôs Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they‚Äôd mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it‚Äôd started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we‚Äôll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve.

Daman and diu and dadra and nagar haveli are a single union territory now. 

Comments: it's high time UP needs to be divided into atleast 5 different states. It has a way too large population to be governed effectively.Ye kya bawaseer bana diye ho be?Of these, which looks ok to split in your view(on paper)? 

To me splitting UP into Harit Paradesh/Awadh/Purvanchal and Vidarbha looks promising in terms of governance. And MP too into possibly 2 states.

All these are too big. Rajasthan has nothing to the west so it can continue being a single state in spite of being the largest state by area.None of the rest is a good idea other than division of Uttar Pradesh. Kongu naadu would basically have the population of two or three of the total districts in TN. There is not that much of a distinct cultural or linguistic difference either. Same for Rajasthan and Rayalseema. It doesn't make sense to make states with such low population. It doesn't help with the administration, just hinders.

UP on the other hand has such a crapton of population that it can easily be divided into 4 states or more.You can also add North Karnataka to the map but it's not mainstream yet.

South Koreans have a sealed lower pressure kiosk for the ones being tested(ours is reverse of this case, the kiosk is for the tester). The tester stands outside the kiosk and his gloves reaches into the kiosk for the test(just like the medical personnel reaching into the car holding the ones being tested), while the person being tested stands inside the kiosk. The seal and the lower pressure in the kiosk stops the virus expelled during a test from spreading to the tester and other people in the room holding the kiosk. After each test the kiosk is disinfected before letting another person in. 

In our case after each test there will be virus all around the kiosk and on the gloves.There's a private lab doing drive-through tests in Delhi as well, similarly inspired by South Korea I think :P

India has a huge surplus with the USA and we export most of the agrarian goods there. If that export gets threatened then it won‚Äôt be good for Indian agricultural sector. To come out of this situation, there is only one solution that is long term development of secondary or industrial sector. But that is impossible to happen in this capitalist hating socialist society. We are taught to hate capitalist and industrialists. Everybody focus on their profit earning, nobody talks about their job generation, GDP creation. Best example here is when TATAs denied to open plant to manufacture cars in singoor West Bengal. There is fucking long list of permits and license. Why would any capitalist invest here if we are taught to hate capitalism.> We are NOT the greatest country in the world.

I want to emphasize so much on it. It's okay to be not the top country in the world. 

But peoples are more interested in giving a pat on their backs by desperately trying to prove that India is the best. And to be honest, nobody in other countries give a shit about our Whatsapp forwards. 

It would have been much better if people actually try to make India the best. Actions speak better than words.Regarding the chloroquine matter, I believe it shows that India has historically been very poor at negotiating for itself despite having a winning hand.

For example, as some have pointed out, India could have negotiated for all WTO claims by the US on the behalf of pharma companies against Indian generics be dropped in return for chloroquine exports (which in fact are generics they are suing against).

We could have negotiated for testing kits (which we seem to lack at this moment) as well as PPEs.

We could have negotiated a leeway in some of the tariffs trump has put on us, lord knows we need it in the post covid 19 economic recession that is looming down the horizon.

Unfortunately, this isn't particularly a Modi fault, though arguably he has run on a platform of global indian outreach.

However, India has always failed at powerprojectikn both globally and locally in the subcontinent.

India is one of the world's largest producers of Chloroquine and produces more than the country needs. At this point banning exports was a poorly thought move, when instead India could have ramped up production of the drug and helped in the global supply - improving power projection.

As for best country and all that jazz - let's be honest, no person who has even an inkling about what goes on outside the country's borders thinks that. Most who do don't watch anything but domestic propaganda that flies for news.MIGA.USA is a world superpower bro,they do whatever they want.They bully not only India but other countries also.We should start enforcing democracy in a few countries with limited resources.

**Unmatched**So here's how active surveillance is being done, any area where we get a single covid 19 case, it gets sealed immediately. Then the CDMO deploys surveillance teams of ASHA and ANM workers (2+1), there are 10 such teams. They go house to house and take contact history with the case, travel history, and if any of them are symptomatic or not. Whichever house doesn't cooperate gets sealed until the cops arrive.

This is done over a period of 8 days, the teams report their findings on a daily basis. The individuals in contact with the active case, with foreign travel history, or with symptoms plus travel history are tested.

The cycle will again be repeated after 8 days so that those who were in contact with any cases detected in the first phase, or any asymptomatic cases who might develop symptoms later on are now covered. This will continue until there are zero new cases.

PS - fuck this insomniaI never look back and say that I missed my childhood, or school days or college days. For me life has always been same, it always sucked equally. I don't miss my childhood, school or college days but I miss childhood me. 

When I was younger, I really felt like I was a pure soul. I genuinely wanted to do things for others and the betterment of the world. Current me is not a bad person either, but I feel like for everything I do, there's a somewhat selfish purpose behind it and that makes me realise how pathetic everything about me is. I'm too lazy to help even myself.. make a better life for me, let alone helping others. Laziness combined with my cynical perception of this world is a very deadly combo.

> Bengaluru: Four policemen were injured when a group of people allegedly attacked them with stones after being asked not to gather for Friday prayers at a mosque in Karnataka's Hubballi, a senior police official said.

> Some among the crowd also were injured in the incident, Hubballi Police commissioner R Dileep said without elaborating.

> ""Today people had gathered at a prayer hall after a call to offer namaz was sounded. Police, out on rounds, requested them not to gather because of the order of the government and to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease but some people got sentimental about it,"" he said.

> The leaders of their community came there and persuaded the agitated people to exercise restraint saying police were performing their duties and they should not obstruct them.

> ""But inspite of that, some people got agitated and hurled stones at the cops. Four (police personnel) persons were injured. They got minor injuries but are back on duty. There is nothing alarming and some people from their community were also injured,"" the commissioner said.

> Presently the situation is peaceful because of the efforts of the police and the community leaders, he said adding that patrolling was on.[removed]A prayer meeting of one person.

&#x200B;

>Aslam, the muazzin of the mosque, recounted how it all started: ‚ÄúI was alone in the masjid and giving azaan (the call to prayer, as giving Azaan is allowed and only congregational prayers are banned). Some policemen just barged into the mosque wearing shoes and started beating me up‚Äù.  
>  
>The police then took Aslam to the Town Police Station, along with the mosque‚Äôs chairman (mutavalli) Dawal Nadaf and a local resident named Basha, who were both standing outside the mosque.  
>  
>Shaista, an eyewitness, confirmed that the police beat up Aslam, Nadaf and Basha before her very own eyes and took them all to the police station.  
>  
>‚ÄúI and my sister pleaded the police to spare them. But the police were so brazen that they dragged my sister by her hair and took her away,‚Äù Shaista said.  
>  
>Local Congress leader Altaf Halwoor, who said he also witnessed the incident, said the police later warned the three men and dropped them back at about 150 metres from the masjid. By then, an angry mob, including several women, had gathered there. A woman then started abusing the police. A police constable retaliated by brandishing his lathi, Halwoor said.  
>  
>‚ÄúWomen and some young men started to pelt stones at the police as a retaliation for their atrocities‚Äù Halwoor said, adding that many local residents, including women, and police personnel sustained injuries.

Also worrisome is medical staff catching the virus and shirting down of hospitals. Besides the moral argument, we need medics and hospitals now more than ever.Holy fucking shit.

Edit: The article even has the full graphic. I would like to be in the mind of the editor that allowed this.Been saying this since the news broke, anyone with minimum knowledge of biostatistics can understand thisThere's a problem with their analysis:

They imply high testing rates would lead to high % of positives. 

A high +ve % implies the authorities were right to test aggressively in this cluster.

549,sudden_dust,"Unpopular opinion, but media is not the one to be blamed. Mainstream media has no agency; it shows only what sells. If the people in a capitalistic-democratic setup like being fed fake news and communal hatred, then the media will naturally capitalise on it. Media is simply a reflection of the society, and not the other way around. So, instead of putting the blame on media, ask why the demand exists in the first place. Nobody watches a video clip or a TV program and turns into an extremist. There are many more factors at play.

Edit: Downvoting is okay, but I'd actually like to hear your views on why do you think that the media should be blamed.Except incase of our people, nothing is flushed and drained out. All is accumulated in their tiny empty brain.[deleted]Taking buttface to a whole new levelThis is the increasingly the case everywhere. The problem is inherent in human psychology. If anyone takes a bit of trouble of reading up on behavioural economics (Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kanheman is a great start), you'll know that humans are anything but rational. People, even after getting PhD's get easily manipulated by framing effects, priming, anchoring. It is also a fact that the more you repeat propaganda the more the public believes something. All these, along with the fact that the information age has given people an access to too much information which they again can never take the time of verifying leaves a lot of room for manipulation. 

Also the simple fact is if you're driven by money, the easiest thing is to pertain to these bugs in human thinking. Add dramatic background music and yell and try and stir up a conflict between religious, political groups and people will tune in. The whole dynamics of the media will be against you if you're trying to do 'real journalism'. I could go on but no one will read this anyway perhaps. 

There's no solution to this. It is human nature. Unless you also want to give a government the power to decide what can or can't be shown, fake news will spread faster than real news...toxic debates with logical fallacies will get more audiences than a more academic debate where both sides try to actually have a conversation. All I can say is read, read as many books as you can. Humans hugely overestimate their decision making abilities and how much they know. It is possible to at least reduce your ignorance the more you read.[Everyone should read this AMA Arnab Goswami tried to do but ignored every important question](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/)Omg!

Large WhatsApp groups are very noisy and you have no control over what can be posted or screenshotted, often out of context.

The WhatsApp Admin arrest thing feels like the worst case of technological illiteracy. 

Almost a year ago, someone I know made a simple group for discussing before exams. Everyone used their contacts and added people from everywhere and it was really great and helpful. Fast forward to a night before exam, everyone was stressed and the group was silent since everyone was busy studying. In these dark times, the guys who are the most Vella are awake.

One of the guys shared a meme about a Historical Figure and some guys got butthurt as it affected their class or something, shared group link with 20 others, abused the shit out of that guy and it went on and on. 

The Admin had his phone shut due to highly obvious reasons, came online 3 hours later and removed those new people,  and the guy who shared the meme who was sorry about it, told everyone that this group ain't for this, and deleted it as well but it was too late.

The People had some ties up and shared screenshot with the police. They got their hands on the person who shared the meme and then the admin who has absolutely no part in this at all. And a huge police case with tons of cash.

Looking at the current situation every group is like the Admin should be responsible for what happens on group and what not. I heard of cases where group admins are arrested, like 20 of them as well, just because some dumb forward was on their group.

**Why exactly is this dumb?**

WhatsApp does not provide any rights to a Group Admin. Apart from Adding and Removing people. 

When a person is removed they can still see the group members and the chats after they are deleted.

A person who is deleted can still have group link and use it to add others untill it's revoked

A Group can have around 40 Admins from any place in India or other. So according to the law or whatever is said, all of those 40 Admins can be held accountable.

Admins are usually a joke in WhatsApp groups. Barely anyone actually respects them.


These issues are really solved in Discord and Telegram where there are very real rights provided to a Moderator or an Admin. And I think even Facebook Group Admins have more rights but this is clearly dumb. I have even heard that some people purposely send messages which can be harmful for a Group or its Admin so that they would be held accountable, while some have even sent messages, and left the group to mentally hurt the Admin. 


And I guess that's the rant. There is no real solution to it, even though a better app exists, no one's going to switch to it be ause some *WhatsApp Forwards* do a fantastic job of *informing people* that these Apps are by some Rival Countries or dumb shit like that.",Rant : The WhatsApp Admin thing,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwhtmr/rant_the_whatsapp_admin_thing/

They are even sanitizing the gloves after every use which was my only concern here.We need this everywhere, and few police officers accompanying every booth to keep social distancingWhat I don‚Äôt understand is.. how does the collected throat swab go from outside the kiosk to inside? Or did it not go inside at all for storage? Where does it go?Go Kerala, go! :-)If central government cooperates with Kerala, it will be the first state to annihilate Corona virus.Pretty neat, I must say. Heard Delhi is going to follow the same footsteps. 

Kerala, Odisha have done a good job in whole of this pandemic. Oh wait, they aren't BJP ruling states, no wonder!Is it possible to be in love with a healthcare system?? Cause I think I amSome good news from our country afterall.Assuming people without proper ppe in the background were there only for the video, it still leaves the person disinfecting the ppe from outside the kiosk vulnerable. A large spray bottle hung at a reachable position outside that can be used by the kiosk operator can solve that problem.Read something similar [about Jharkhand](https://twitter.com/aditya_twitts/status/1246355043336343555) a couple of days back.Couple of doubts on this ? 
1. Will there be data comparing the efficiency of conventional sampling versus the kiosk sampling - because already the pharyngeal swabs thats used for screening has a poor sensitivity (approximately 30) 
2. The actual kiosk is placed inside a bigger room and just has a exhaust fan which exactly isn‚Äôt securing the person inside who isn‚Äôt even wearing a n95. Isn‚Äôt this going to be hazardous to the person sampling and also who ever is in that room.
100 percent for the idea and effort . Need better implementation strategies.Great initiative. More and more states should follow Kerala in this fight against corona.My thoughts are with you all.There's one in Delhi as wellGood social distancing in the back groundIt‚Äôs a sample collection remote handler prototype.

I can think of only two possible scenarios of why they could do it.

1. The media has completely sold itself and its morals down the drains and is doing it for money and the media channel owners want to become rich.

2. The media has done something wrong that the current government has caught a hold of. Due to which, the government is forcing them to do it in order to avoid prison.

My inclination is more towards the second possibility since I think people are still humans in the end and no one would actively do what the Indian media is doing.

True, there is still a lot of bad things happening, but the big picture is gradually getting better.

In the context of India, there are a few parameters I considered that show the growth of the society - 

1. Population - Contrary to the popular belief, our population growth has in fact slowed down to almost half it growth rate from previous years.
2. Fertility Rate - Our average fertility rate is lower than the world average! We started from \~6 children per woman after independence and have gone down to \~2.1. The world average is 2.4.
3. Life expectancy - Our life expectancy is improving at a rate almost 2x the world average.

A Red pill for all the intolerant,bigoted Indians who are insidiously targeting religious minority directly and indirectly against the secular spirit of our constitution.

The language used in the post mentioned in one of the prominent subreddit relating to India is filled with deceitful, fraudulent, fictitious material which can be valued as malicious subjective personal opinion, having full slandering and negligible facts.

The accusations are based on the rumours circulating on WhatsApp. This itself can prove no credibility and unreliability of source of the post.Most of the viral videos where Muslims doing all criminal activities are have been proved fictitious, google and you will get. Read twitter and trust worthy newspapers. No doubts some of fringe elements among Muslims have misbehaved but is the correct deduction for the general Muslims? Are you that irrational and stupid?Sticking to the COVID-19 disease, and the alleged spread of corona virus by ""Muslims"" in India. This is a fact that a group of people have attended a religious congregation which is related to propagation Islamic religion in India, totally allowed under Art. 25 of our Constitution for all religions. The fact,approved and proven by the Govt. that this congregation has lead to become one of the instrumental factors in spread of the virus. This fact is not disputed, and its true. It a setback to India's fight against the virus. These people should co-operate with medical fraternity and district administration now. Lesson learned.

Now, Are you gonna now count, the number of positive COVID-19 cases on basis of religion? Is that the society we want to live in? and guess what, Muslims wont be leading the figures.

But the provocatory language and the malafide intent, to show superiority over the least educated, poorest community in India. Does one get a hard on from squishing the weak? Is that one's upbringing. Does this make the speaker any better than the weak? if Yes, Guess what, YOU are insecure and emotionally weaker.

Is this the fraternity and unity of our country? Read the preamble of our Constitution.

Does anyone think, by blaming and insulting, making derogatory comments against Muslim community makes you any better?

Should not we as egalitarians support, help, inform and educate the backward community? Will witch hunting and blood-lust do any good?

Are you doing any help by forwarding the hateful messages on social media? This is to all the hate monger irrespective of your religion.

By equating a religion to a cult, such immature analogy will make all religion a cult. The difference between a religion and cult is what society thinks is unusual. It is left to the society to decide, not by majoritarianism. Sorry, sheer number cannot decide what is correct and not correct.

On one hand lecturing canny advice and other hand, mischievously mockery of stereotypical physical attributed of an Muslim. Be specific, dont try to fool the redditors here by your veil of ""advice"". We are smarter than that. The post's colourable rant exhorts hate and poison. Grow a pair of balls to say it straight.

I believe in our public servants, medical fraternity, and the Indians, as well as the world. Humanity have been tested and we have survived, we have lost and will lose our fellow dear humans. Alas, the mortality of our lives.We are grateful to stand on the ""shoulders of giants"". Nations can be selfish but people aren't. We are social beings, its the co-operation which has build and will build our long term future not childish competition and selfishness. I urge the sensible redditors to resist such people. All the fringe elements of all religion, Remember, Yours hate speeches serve no purpose, listen and observe the harmony of the society.

606,anotheruser2221,"> 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

Testing is not done in thin air. It needs suitable labs, technicians, logistics of collection, equipments and so on. $60 is the cost of a test kit, you forgot to price other things.

>  I would also go further and say that we should make all international passengers who arrive get this done a few days after arrival (and make them pay for it)

This should happen. Singapore has been doing it.that $60 is a mythical figure from the price cap of the US-FDA approved CoSara kits that the government was trying to push as a de facto standard through restrictive guidelines - in what many (reasonably) suspect to be a dodgy quid pro quo for the Gujrat based Sarabhai group. This is not a good number to base scale-up calculations on

NIV already validated various test kits costing as little as 400 to 500 rupees and the govt. buckled under pressure last week as ICMR rolled back those arbitrary guidelines and approve those kits. Once supply-chain for mass production is established, we can only expect these costs to come down further. Rapid testing kits are also being developed which can also bring down logistical and personnel costs indirectly.

Scaling up testing is a very achievable goal and is proven to be the only reliable way to keep the pandemic in check. Keeping testing free **for everyone** is the only way to ensure as many people as possible can be tested, and fast.

It seems like a small spark can cause a fire.

One of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. Several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. I am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking India as a case.

Some back of the envelope calculation:

Cost of a test: upto 60$ (in India)
Doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

This sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. So, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. And there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

There can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. I am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown. Basically, pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future.

PS1: Note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly (say an order of magnitude) if we scale up.

615,UtopianSoldier,"The Indian Govt. and many others around the world are trying to flatten the peak. This is so that the health services of the country are not overwhelmed by patients who are sick (or claim to be corona positive). In India we also have limited tests available, this creates a bottleneck in recognizing positive cases, we are only testing those with severe/obvious symptoms, over time this will change and more people will be able to get tested. NOTE: Flattening the peak has very little to do with lowering the infection rate through the community as a whole. Flattening the peak is to change the rate of infection/spread it over a longer number of days so those that do get infected have a chance to survive. It is only to ensure that when people get sick, there is enough medicine, ventilators etc to help the ones that get sick.
These lockdown measures are also useful for other health issues> like when people go to the hospital with a accident and need ventilators or other medicine etc. or other threatening surgical procedures, right now doctors, nurses, testing labs etc are busy with coronovirus related cases.

Even though the Indian Govt. is not officially recognizing it yet, we already have community spread (i.e people who didn't travel from/to infected areas abroad) testing positive for the virus. 


The lockdown is to ensure that the rate of infection remains low as the virus spreads through physical contact/droplets and remaining viable over different surfaces for a period of time. 25K is already a high number. The growth rate for viral infection is exponential and very hard to stop/control(> hence the term that something went 'viral').

This is the only strategy we have to combat this as of now. There are no conclusive studies yet on how effective medicines such as hydroxychloroquine are for the time being. There are large scale tests going on, but it will be a few weeks to few months before we have better understanding. 

Vaccine development is also going on, but it takes about 1 to 1.5 years before something is ready and enough production and distribution is achieved.

We don't have medication that directly combats the virus but only slows its progression or prevents secondary infections (which is why we need to have sufficient health care services available).

There is no evidence yet (atleast confirmed from multiple sources) about herd immunity. People who recover do shows some signs of immunity but we don't know how long it lasts and whether they can get re-infected or are are immune to re-infection.

Source: Biologist/Scientist (but not a epidemiologist or virologist)#1: A) Are they trying to cure all infected people of Coronavirus so there is no more ill person or B) they are trying to infect everyone at a slow rate so that no more person is left to infect?

Neither. This is to flatten the curve to ensure that health services are not overwhelmed.

#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

618,voodoodopetrain,"1.Not an expert , but valuations and actual cash flow are completely different items , Ola burns a lot of money in customer acquisition and is NOT a profit making entity yet
2.The gesture for driver relief is much appreciated , they are not obliged to pay the drivers, the drivers earn on a commission basis the demand , they are already doing the bit they can .
3. I also saw a series of articles on how they are working with the Govt for waivers on auto loans for their driver community 
- Let‚Äôs not take the pitch fork each time , and be grateful atleast 
4.I will not choose to comment on the salary piece, I personally think it‚Äôs a good gesture note that his net worth is also including Ola shares , which are valuable only if the company does well , which he is working very hard towards

( made some punctuation changes )This post sounds like you just want to get on the anti-capitalism bandwagon. And I say all this without bias. I'm no fan of Ola. I wouldn't take their rides even if they offered me free service.

1. Ola had 15 lakh drivers as of 2019. Even if it were to give everyone just Rs 2,000 as a one-time gesture, that's 300 crores. I guess most would agree you need, at the very least, Rs 5000 to get thru this period. That's 750 crores.

2. So whether they donate 20 or 50 cr, it doesn't matter. If you were Ola management, you'd want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you're going to run short. I'd appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers, instead of bashing such moves.

3. Don't forget that they are ultimately a loss-making entity (losing more than 2000 crores every year). They're not raising VC money to channel it all to charity. And, like other comments have mentioned, they don't even have adequate cash in the first place. Valuation != cash in hand. Do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers? Why?

4. Ola's top management has already taken salary cuts, with the CEO letting go of his entire annual salary. Yeah you could argue it's no biggie as he's still filthy rich. But so what? What more do you want them to do? And why, in the first place? 

So why is this surprising? Are you new to capitalism?

u wot m8?Chutiye.. Valuation is not cash on hand.daily reminder that valuation doesn't mean cash in hand. And yes, ceo should just donate his annual salary because unke paas ""bohot"" paise h that he didn't earn with his skill.Do you even finance mate?Anyone who posts stuff like this should be made to take a course in basic corporate finance.Valuations are used to get more funding, and then they burn through that, only to come up with a higher valuation next time for higher funding. It's a vicious cycle. Ola and such companies can never be profitable with the same approach, they're just going down a path of no return and making as much as they can in the process. The tenet of business is the same today as it was a 100 years ago: You go on spending more than you earn, the bubble will burst and you're going belly up. No exceptions.Lol this is very Whatsapp uncle finance logic.OP, you should learn some basic economicsDai, first understand the difference between Valuation, Cashflow, Revenue and Runway. Then write chutiya posts like these.Most Indian startups are money sucking cesspools. They claim to innovate, but do not.

Uber and all the sharing economy companies are never going to be profitable. See their stock calls and annual reports if you think I'm lying.Learn basic economy OP, they probably aren't even making any money or it's very razor thin, a month of lock down and following uncertainty is already huge dent in there revenueOla CaresOla is paying its employees.  The drivers aren't employees.They don't pay their drivers. They give the drivers approx 80% of the ride fare.Denmark govt has agreed to pay 75% of employees salaries for all companies for next 3 months. Which basically means people's tax $ are used as a wage subsidy. This happens because companies don't have much liquidity & financial institutions don't have much liquidity to give loans. So the govt acts as lender of last resort.

Its not much different than companies asking for donations from people here.This is because crazed mentality of Indians running after discounts and offers. There is no brand loyalty and crazy competition from outsideThat's not how company valuations work. The billions in valuation refer to their stock. You can't pay employees in stock. You need liquid money.It is. Fuck 'em. Btw you're right about the PR stunt angle. It makes the little people who donate feel like they're personally invested in the company (we're all in this together one for all all for one and all that good stuff) when the millionaire company execs themselves clearly aren't.

Also loling at all the people shilling for these Ahole corporates in this thread.. far too many of them.I did enquire about their model. The drivers have to give a certain amount of money every month to their 'handler' while they get to keep the surplus (if they make any that is). Sometimes they pay it out of their own pocket.It's insane and all around the world 

The CEO's cant stand giving away few dollars from their obscene amount of millions.",1586188317.0,fw14l3,Business/Finance,94,/r/india/comments/fw14l3/isnt_it_just_fucking_great_how_companies_like_ola/,256,"And I know that a lot of upper management in the company has donated  (total amounting to 20cr.)  It still doesn't make any sense that the larger part of the Fund had to be crowdfunded when the company could take care of the whole amount and more while barely taking a hit.

Retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation. This means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SALARY while acting like caring, charitable employers.

And don't even talk about the CEO forgoing an entire year of his salary. When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country , this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is: cheap PR bullshit. And let's not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around 3100 crore.

Tldr; fuck you Ola, we got bills to pay too.

No 2: Indians worship fair skin. Its an odd combination of caste system with british class system.Stock images ig.I have worked in marketing before and the short answer is it's hard to find stock images of Indians whereas you can easily find stock images for other races doing almost anything.

The only solution for us then is to either try to ""fit"" the stock image into the context or do a photoshoot which is at least 10 times more expensive than using a stock image.It's called using stock photography, usually RFAs an advertising agency employee, when working with an Indian cellphone brand, we were given specific instructions to look for Indian models only from Shutterstock. They had to be fair. It gave an impression of a well groomed, decently paid Indian 'jobber' - employee. Their major Target Audience was in central India, young students and entry level employees and the ads generally targeted their aspirations. So that's one side of the story. 

Then came the chillar companies, they didn't want to spend money on Stock Images and wanted us to google them. Ok. Whatever pays our bills and generally it's always like an underlying assumption that fair skinned, a good jaw line, smiling man or woman had to be chosen for our mocks to get approved.

Even pet stores will have a button nosed, blonde girl with two ponytail running behind a golden retriever in their flex board.

And how can we forget the tuition classes \ computer class adverts & pamphlets & brochures which have the whole high school stereotype clique posing with bags & large books - one girl in glasses, a white guy in a green tee shirt, the athletic looking jock who's almost always African, an adorable Asian girl in a chic jacket - among others.

628,privilegedladka,"Think about these points that I could remember, before making a decision and if you have never considered these points then you seriously need to research about it.

1. You're staring at expense of around minimum $35k to $65k per year (tuition fees, rent, food, insurance), so total cost of 4 year undergrad program=$140k to $260k. You said in a comment that your father can spend around $30k so you would have to take a loan of around $110k minimum to $230k. Scholarships are hard to get if you don't have an exceptional CV. Legally you can work for only 20-hour per week while on student visa. On-campus jobs and TA are hard to get. It's not that easy to handle the pressure of regular quizzes, assignments, exams along with part-time job, cooking and household chores.

2. Weather is good in south-west (around Silicon valley), but if your university is on east coast (Boston, NYC, Chicago etc) then 3-4 months of winter might become depressing.

3. As you would be going on a student visa, you most probably have to do a job to get a work visa. And it's complicated to start a business on H1B visa. Check the visa rules.

4. Internships are very hard to get. You might have to apply to 50-100 companies to get a reply from 2-3 companies. Many companies prefer US nationals or GC holders over international students in offering a job. 

Go through subs like r/internships, r/gradadmissions, r/resume etc, watch videos of YouTubers who depict reality of undergrad/grad in US and search on Google regarding all these because grass is always greener on the other side. Given the situation of recession, it would at least take 1-2 years for businesses to go back to normal.

Better option would be to aim for IITs, IIITs, NITs, BIT etc, they too offer ample opportunities and platforms to grow yourself.Check out iiit in Hyderabad. All the iits also have some type of incubator. Check out t hub in hyd. They support entrepreneurs. Good luck.I would like to know how much percentage you will get in 12th board to recommend you universities and also let me know your budgetCheck out the ipm programme in iim indore!!!Consider doing a master's degree abroad instead of a bachelor's. I would suggest this even if you've somehow got the money to fund a bachelor's degree.

Study in India, go to the best colleges if you can, maybe even work a bit like everyone else, gain valuable life experiences and then reevaluate whether you still have the itch to study abroad. If you do, make a plan,kick into high gear and pursue whatever you want.

Hopefully by then, you will also understand that words like innovation, entrepreneurship etc are not things you learn from an University but they are personal attitudes you acquire via experiences and how you react to them.

However one thing that people may be under estimating, is the power of social media.

Recently in a discussion, one of the positions we arrived at was that it doesn‚Äôt matter how good Modi is, it all pales in comparison to the social media messaging .Pt. 2?
Someone got. Link to part 1?Probably the work of his PR agency. Every world leader has such agencies who program each and every action as if the person were a robot. I think Mr.Modi was very outspoken before he became PM. Now  he feels like a robot. Planned speeches with zero direct interaction and with hidden agendas.That's well deconstructed.

""Ask not what your country can do for you...""Sorta reminds of Stockholm Syndrome. The citizens have developed a psychological alliance through this methodology, despite their sufferings.  
Say what you want about the govt., they understand human nature and are master manipulators. The very basic requirement for becoming a great leader.This is amazing. I always felt it and never was able to describe it as nicely as you did. Great job.

Also Tinder passport is free this week.[Check this out](https://youtu.be/_LwwObssPno)I understand that the basic idea of a democracy of a free country is the right to voice opinion of criticism, and all of us are well within our rights to voice them.

But when it comes to calling our government the worst in terms of coping with the covid -19 pandemic, I think we are going a bit overboard.

Don't get me wrong, our Government is by no means doing a great job. But which other country is? Germany and South Korea? I bet you could come up with not more than a handful of countries so are doing a great job at containing the virus. The U.S. efforts are laughable even though they are picking up, the same goes with that of the U.K, Spain and Italy. China's initial lackadaisical efforts are the reason why we are where we are at now. France are not doing much better either. Each of these developed countries' government's frailties have been put under the spotlight due to the pandemic.

I feel India made a great decision with such an early lockdown. But admittedly, the preparations and the implementation were way below par. And Modi's clapping and lighting lamps gimmicks are not helping either.

The point I am trying to make is, even though I get we should be concerning ourselves with the issues in our country the foremost, we should also consider that it is not just our government who has been bad with dealing with the pandemic, there are as bad and far worse cases of governance, a few of them even in developed countries.*Jo Bhi Main, Kehna Chahoon*

She was such a bombshell before her babies came along. I once read Jessica considered toothpaste a waste of money. I wonder what she used as a breath freshener. Well, heading a billion dollar business now may have changed her oral hygiene practices. Which in no way suggests I wouldn't have given anything to taste her even back then. 

When I'm not in the mood to jerk off yet wanna pleasure myself I often listen to her song ""I wanna love you forever"" with the video. Damn. I wonder if it's the makeup team or if Jessica Simpson was sculpted in a fine art class.Anyone brought up or living in a joint family ?

I'm mainly curious to understand how Indian Muslims in general perceive the majority religion. I imagine most don't think much about it.What is the attitude of your friends/family towards the Kashmir movement? Do they support it but do not speak out because of fear? Are they nationalistic?Can you name some people (historical or present day) that Muslims look up to or consider their role models?Which exmuslim Youtubers influenced you the most? For me it's Apostate Prophet and Abdullah Sameer.What do you think of the Hijab?Did your opinion of homosexuality change after you left Islam?Hi. Another ex-muslim here.

I never felt discriminated against growing up. Even now the only discrimination I have felt is on TOI comments and Twitter. 

The reason I left religion is because I felt I was living a lie. I feel I should read up about other religions, especially Hinduism and it's rich culture.Some of the dalit bahujan pages I follow talk about the Ashraf-Syed (upper caste) vs the Pasmanda(lower caste) muslims. 

They talk about how the Hindu-Muslim binary is created by Brahmins and Ashrafs to benefit themselves, and that the true source of conflict is not Hindu vs Muslim but Brahmin-Ashraf vs Bahujan-Pasmanda. Brahmins and Ashrafs are the ones with wealth and influence within their communities, the people who give speeches, but it is the bahujan pasmandas, the working classes, that die in riots, while the brahmin Ashrafs win seats in parliament. The Hindu-muslim binary is useful in ending any caste class consciousness that may arise among bahujan pasmandas. 

So my question is - how relevant is caste among Indian Muslims? Is endogamy practiced in any form? (I've heard syeds used to only marry amongst themselves but now they marry other upper caste muslims as well - similar to how brahmins now marry baniyas as well)
Is there an overlap between these caste groups and wealth/income levels?why you left Islam? (please mention the details as I'm studying the religion myself)

Here is a link I found:

I see you are a man of culture as wellHello, and thanks for doing this AMA!

In Hinduism, there are some people who claim their ancestors were Aryans, which is to say, not the inferior locals :-), and who feel pretty proud of themselves for that. What about among Muslims? Are there those who claim to be descended from Arabs/Turks etc and feel proud about that? Do the others in the community give them any extra respect for that?

Secondly, among Muslims, in your experience, how literally do people take the fanciful stories? Eg the story that Muhammed travelled on a horse and went to heaven and came back. Is the story considered figurative or the literal truth?I think its great that you are critically examining your religious beliefs and the Quran. Its a step in becoming a more well-rounded and knowledgeable person. I agree with your point that there is no ""hard evidence"" of a lot of things that are mentioned in the holy books.
 
However I am not convinced if they are to be taken literally and hence its a narrow view to subject them to scientific empiricism. Its not a scientific claim or experiment after all. Every story is open to interpretation, if it really happened or not to exact accuracy is irrelevant to most people.

 I believe there are a lot of moral lessons that can be derived from the stories of the Bible, Quran or any of the Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh and other religious mythologies and they can help you lead a life which is more rounded and in harmony with the society. I am not advocating for religion per se but just to take what you can from it and find your own path.

On that note would like to end with this debate (check link), Hasan is one of my favorite Muslim journalist and a lot of his moral courage comes from being a religious Muslim.

637,sentientwizard,"As a 21 year old closeted gay indian dude, all I can say is I relate so fucking much. At this point suicide is a fantasy for me that I think about when I'm depressed and it actually makes me feel better. A form of escapism I guess.

But recently I think I should stop thinking about suicide.
It not an option with old parents who didn't invest in any sort of retirement plan. If my parents were not in the picture, I would've killed myself long ago. 

As for coming out of the closet, I've decided that I'm never going to do it. I'm sure most of my friends won't take it well and my parents are so conservative that I won't even consider outing myself to them lol.

Marriage is no no. It's not about me, It's about not ruining another person's life just because I was dealt a bad deck of cards.

My plan right now is to become as financially independent as possible and distract myself with entertainment till I die ( or when my parents die, in which case I can happily kill myself ). 

But ughh what I wouldn't give for a boyfriend who I can hug and cuddle and fall asleep with when I come back home from work :([deleted]Hey, listen to me, it **will** get better, no matter how bleak it looks now. I know it because at your age I also felt suicidal because I was gay, depressed and did not know where to go. My family was pressuring me to get married by parading a list of lovely ladies. The only difference is that I could move abroad. In time, I fell in love, got married to a wonderful guy, and now, ten years later, the past feels like a nightmare that is fading away each day. Love yourself and you will survive this and flourish.

DM me if you want to chat.I have no comments on most of the things you mentioned but the guilt part. Nope don't be, there's nothing wrong being gay. It's not a ""fault"". You didn't ""ask"" your parents, for you to be born. There's indeed some level of gratitude you show to parents, but doesn't mean you're enslaved for ever. It is their duty to take of their children till they're able. If they can't , shouldn't make children.Being an internet stranger I can't do much but i have 1 suggestions and 1 question

Suggestion: (from a 33 straight single guy with younger cousins who are married) if anyone asks why aren't you or when are getting married just say something on the lines of ""we'll see when I meet the right person"". Nod. Agree. Dont argue. Your sexuality is none of their business.

Question : why is it that you question yourself if you are taking your parents happiness from them while they are not questioning if they are taking your happiness and giving importance to society's gossip?Get to a psychologist who does CBT and/or hypnotherapy. At the very least, you need to evolve habits of non-isolation and limited social engagement (on your terms). Re. being gay, please remember: yours is the paradigmatic crisis felt by thousands of young boys and girls who grow up into emotionally and psychically compromised adults. Hell, even het kids are routinely scarred by patriarchal rigidity. You must first come to terms with your own gayness. Accept who you are and not because you came out. Your being gay is biochemically distinct from your having depression. The latter is a malaise and requires expert, outside help; the former requires you to understand yourself and put yourself in situations where you can hang out with other men and women, and enjoy the company of those that you respond to physically and intellectually. I know you wrote to vent, but write more to vent more? You write well. Habits are the key to breaking any rut-- begins with a series of reassuring small steps you can take everyday: eg, going for a walk to get milk, doing a sudoku puzzle, cutting a cucumber, writing in a journal, listening to something progressively different like a symphony. Make these habits to force yourself to see time not as one monolith of nothing revolving around your stasis but as morsels of activities that you must do in order to complete self-drawn tasks. Don't give up. You matter.Hey there I'm  fellow 20 old gay myself idk but seeing this made me feel I'm not alone I'm in a similar situation myself and I'm so depressed and have had constant suicidal thoughts and alone always and I've never come out to anyone because I have no job to protect myself if all hell break loose I never had a boyfriend aswell.

I'm failing in my college used to get good grades before my college tho so guaranteed I won't be able to land a job idk I'm pretty fucked and don't see a future for me at all tbh and I can't afford any professional help yet being in tier 1 city because I'm always broke I guess suicide is the only option I'm just hanging on cause I simply don't have the courage to do it nor to live life.
I think I may be bipolar aswell I'm not sure

My advice is same as others try moving to a tier 1 city

DM me if you want to talk more or feel less lonely I won't say any cheesy things like it'll get better because I honestly have no idea but I'll be there to listen to whatever you have to say <3

For suicidal thoughts this sub helps r/suicidewatchIf your parents are unhappy they are only doing it to themselves. You havent done anything wrong or hurt them in any way. They are victims of their own unevolved mindset. It is so easy to be happy, but people just get caught up in the most useless bullshit and make their own lives miserable. You have so much to offer the world, and the fights you fight will pave the way for the future generations. It‚Äôs not a fair burden for you to carry but thats the way it is. Please seek counseling and gain financial independence. Things will get better!First do not marry cuz of peer pressure, you will not be doing anyone ant service - only you , the girl you marry and the parents of both parties will have to handle the issues later.
The uncles and aunties who come for the wedding will disappear afterwards to dress up for the next wedding.


So no, second - You can always move to a different country, especially Europe if you apply yourself . Just see what skills can be transferred and start working on it.  

And as other had suggested, try moving cities , a change will take your mind off things temporarily.As a gay man myself, I am so sorry you have to go through this. I've gone through a similar situation, and still struggle with anxiety disorder. I'm somehow no longer suicidal, so I'm thankful for that.

I don't know if I have advice to give, but if you want a listening and understanding ear, you can always DM me. 

Therapy is a slow process, it's not easy to find the combination of medicines that works, but hold on, I'm sure something will work out.It will get better, i don't know when but it will , please move forward with hopeGo see a decent therapist. Keep changing doctors till you find one. Most therapists in india are shit, but finding a good one is worth it. 

You aren't in a hopeless situation. You are simply in a temporary bad situation where the amount of your pain is steadily increasing relative to the amount of ways you have to cope with it. Thus making it seem like there's no way out. There definitely are ways. Look for them and they will appear.

Homophobia is everywhere. You can't run away from it, irrespective of country. Just accept your current situation and work on your immediate problems for now.

Even if you don't have a boyfriend, you are still a 100% healthy, valid person with exactly the same worth you would have if you did have a boyfriend. A relationship is just something that enriches your life. The lack of it doesn't make your worth lesser. The more relationships you get in, the more mature you'll become and your approach to relationships will become healthier.

The exact same thing applies to your relationship with your parents. I'm bisexual and I've been through some of this. I've also been suicidal when I was younger.  It's not the end of the world. It's just another problem to work out. You CAN work these things out. It's just a question of how. If you choose to disregard them or try to talk to them, both are entirely valid solutions and you're more equipped to decide which would work.

Keep reminding yourself that things will be okay. You just need to concentrate your efforts on gaining more resources, like minded friends and ways to cope with and solve your issues. You WILL find those if you keep looking.

Good luck and you can always DM me when you need an ear.Sorry to hear. First of all and this is the most important, look after your mental health and go see a therapist.

Marrying a woman is neither fair to you nor to her either,think about that.

Now about disapointing/shaming your parents.... Your parents most probably love you, they want you to be a happy, succesful, good hearted human being, nothing more nothing less and you can achieve those regardless of your sexual orientation, even if it takes some time for them to realise that.  

Wish you all the best and don't give up on yourself.Sorry to hear about your pain. For starters, I think you should quit getting high. I know it seems like a good escapade, especially when you're going through a rough patch, but it does more harm to you mentally. Why don't you start a new hobby instead, maybe learn a new language or pick up a music instrument just to keep your mind distracted and occupied for the time being? Do anything to try and keep those negative thoughts away. Once that's done you'll automatically start feeling better and perhaps even have a positive outlook towards life and your future. You said you are working towards saving money, which is good. Why don't you use that money to go abroad and fulfill your dream? Once you are settled abroad, you can always take care of your parents financially from there. Just hang in there, bro. Everything is not lost.

What if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? Should I just give up on life where I could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

All these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! I never had any friend that I could trust to tell them that I have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that I have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn‚Äôt help. I have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and I feel that hell is inside me.

I feel so alone and dejected in life. All I have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. All my life I adapted to not feel anything and do everything like I have been told. I get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. I have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

Honestly I thought I could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. I don‚Äôt have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that I am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. There is inherently something wrong with me and I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. Travelling is all I wanted to do. But all I can think of is how fucking ugly I am with absolutely no skills to boast for. Like being a useless log that lies in bed all day.

Don't wait to become a cabbage to move to such living. Make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there.Am 37 and unmarried. I think my only fear is medical emergencies. 

Rest all can be managedI think you are missing the point of marriage. 

It‚Äôs less to do with spousal/children support as you grow old, and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships. As a 65 year old, let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences I have had in my life. It has completed me. She is now 30plus, doing her own thing, in another country, and I certainly don‚Äôt expect her to come and stay and look after me when I am old and infirm. And I cannot but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter. 

My wife is my age, and we have now started the journey of looking after one another. When she was ill, I stayed by her side, and when I suffered a heart attack recently, she stayed by mine. And we keep fussing over each other. It‚Äôs called growing old together. 

But yes, I did plan financially for my older years, and those plans have more or less come to fruition. But that‚Äôs just a bonus. The main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships, although I will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems. But when you put everything on a scale, I would gladly go through all this again and again. 

So don‚Äôt look at marriage as a prop for your old age. That‚Äôs silly. Look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships,  and going through the joys, the trials and the tribulations of parenthood.I am 31 and single. The point of marriage is not to find a woman who'll replace my mother. If that is the need then I'll get a nurse in old age or go to an old age home. 

Unless I don't find a partner who has a similar mindset, has a personality of her own, is equally ambitious and will carry on in future even if I am not around, there is no point in saying yes to a random woman just for the sake of someone being there when I am old. 

I have seen couples who got married at 26 and have spent 4-5 years just quarreling and arguing on pety topics. People who didn't get a chance to understand each other before marriage and are now regretting. I don't want to live in such a marriage. 

My parents forced me into engineering and after two years I realised that this place is not for me. The argument that my parents used to send me to this Engg College was that it will give you a well settled lifestyle and secure future. After a year I was suicidal. Now if I get married because it is a guarantee to secure old age and not because I really like the girl (and she likes me back) then chances are that I (or both of us) will end up in a similar situation and I won't get an option like dropping out of this course without thinking of some serious repercussions.Its crazy to me how many people in India look at marriage and kids as an ""investment for the future"" rather than the personal relationship they are supposed to be at the present. Guess that's why arranged marriages and the pressure to marry is so common. Its not so much a natural alignment of 2 people sharing their lives and more like a cold business transaction? Its quite strange.Hmm.. a lot of people have expressed their opinions.. as of me, I‚Äôm almost in the same boat as you.. my suggestion is to start saving and invest in PPF, FD & KVP. Eat healthy and exercise.. when you‚Äôre old and single, go to a old age home..Shotgun to my face. That's my plan for, when I'm old.> not so much about loneliness

Let me ask you a question. Do you feel lonely now? Do you have friends to hang out with frequently now? Or someone really close to you?

You don't have to answer that here. That's for yourself.

The point is people get married because it gets lonely after a while. Now I'm only 28 but I know for a fact that I can't live alone. If I could have a partner and not get married that's fine too. But people need stability, legal benefits and financial benefits. So most people prefer a marriage. Not to mention that it has a social meaning to it.

> But I sometime wonder what will happen to me?

It's funny how you feel this already and yet thought of not getting married. The point of marriage is companionship. Kids taking care of parents is such an old concept. Let the kids live free. It's only the parents responsibility to groom them, guide them and let them find their way. You do that out of love not out of obligation.

And if you don't want that responsibility, don't have kids!

You and your partner will take care of each other. And you have to plan for the worst case anyway in case you become all alone.

Hope you find your way.I plan to never get married. There are several reasons for it, failed marriage of my parents is one of them, but i just don‚Äôt know how to convince my parents. Following are the challenges.

1) my mom always tell me what will society think, like am i gay or something. No i am not but if I don‚Äôt get married my parents will get embarrassed by this things

2) my parents said i will feel very alone and will get depressed when i will come home and there will be no one to welcome me. (Like i am not already depressed haha)

3) our society just treats single men as a threat. How to handle that.

This is all i can think of right now, and i am really messed up to have any relationship ever. So option of getting married is off the table. Just how to explain this to parents.Future is here bro don't worry I'm 25 I decided not to get married even I told this to my parents
The best idea is savings then you can afford everything
In future, old age home and care is going to be a big business so don't worryI'm so relieved to see so many people in the Same boat.

Even I share the same fears about my sunset years..With the way medical science is improving, the quality of life by the time you hit 70 would be vastly improved. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much. If you save up there are well managed old age homes you can enter as well.Marriage you say..

*Silently cries while being 30 and unemployed*I am not planning to marry. I have decided to have kids whether its my own/adopted. As for my end of life care i plan to earn enough to support my self till i die.Two of my aunts remained unmarried. One is nearing 70 and the other is around 60. They are happy and content in their lives and with the decision they have made. 

The aunt nearing 70 had a dream home in mind, which they constructed after retirement. The home has a separate portion for any live-in househelp or nurses they might employ in the future.

As for loneliness, I doubt my aunts get lonely as my family (mom's immediate family) is very close, supportive, and helpful. All of them stay physically close to each other so they meet multiple times a week. Some meet everyday as 4 of the families are neighbors. If anyone needs help, the others are always ready help them.

Also, having hobbies helps. My aunts love reading and gardening and now is the time for them to do so without being stressed about office work. 

So, if you invest well in yourself, in other non-romantic relationships and in plan well financially, you will be good.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it to old age. I doubt I‚Äôll make it past 30.You're 32, there's no guarantee that you'd not want marriage when you're 35 or even 45. Our minds change and evolve mate, I doubt such decisions will stay relevant from 32 yrs all the way to 70 yrs. When I look back at some decisions and outlooks I had 10 years ago, I laugh at myself. We all learn and grow. However, always do whatever keeps you happy.problem is there arent any good affordable old age homes in this country, and the ones that provide good service are out of the reach of most middle class indiansThis is the plan underway: money, passport, visa, permanent residency, naturalization, and then maybe marriage.

In other words I am leaving India as soon as possible...

When you are young you become part of the network and take care of elderlies in that network. You get some reward points for that. You accumulate as many reward points as you can till you are able to take care of others. Once you are in need of care you can use these reward points (basically pass it to somebody else) and they will take care of you.

Don't do this or that, adjust or be chained down due to circumstances it could bring with it.

Added to that, I'm mentally unfit to maintain any kind of relationship dynamic. All I see is misery, headache and a shit ton of worrying (which could have been avoided) but the best counter-argument I get is that it is for the fulfillment and ""that's the best part!"" which is unconvincing for me. 

Plus a (very-very) small contribution in the population decline won't do any harm. I hate kids anyways.Old age retirement homes and communities. Kids born after 2000 or so will certainly not be inclined to act as their parents' carers.I find it commendable that you know what you want out of your life at 32. You are still young. 

I don't agree with people mentioning here about getting married for fulfilling relationships. You should still be able to have those without ever marrying. I have met people whose kids are abroad and spouses have passed away, living their lives by themselves. It would definitely help to have even one close siblings/cousins/friends in similar situation. And not having extra expenses of kids, you may be able to retire much earlier.Filipina 'caregiver'Work on yourself, your mind, your body, your finances. Believe it or not, just because you're not deciding to get married, you still need to work on your relations. The best scenario can be that you have a good group of friends and family that have younger people that you can relate with. 

Also - FYI just because you're not getting married doesnt mean that you cant be partnered, this way you always have a person.As another man said it before in another comment, getting married and having children, grandchildren is mostly about your growth in life. With every step you take in life you get to grow more as a person. Getting married, having kids, they all change you and that‚Äôs how you mature in different ways. If you don‚Äôt do this, you risk becoming an old person who can‚Äôt connect with the other old people around because they‚Äôve all been through stuff that you haven‚Äôt been through and it‚Äôs too late. Secondly, with age, your social life becomes your family, pretty much exclusively. It happens that when you‚Äôre young, everyone your age almost shuns family in favour for coworkers, friends and acquaintances. This is short lived. Later on, all these people will become too busy with their own personal lives, and they won‚Äôt reach out to you for an emotional connection or friendship. Not because they don‚Äôt want to, but because they slowly get sucked into their own growing family and it‚Äôs occupying all their time and emotional energy, which also ends up becoming their main source of satisfaction too. 

Lastly, it‚Äôs one thing ending up by yourself and unmarried during old age because of circumstances beyond your control, and another thing ending up like this out of your own choice. The feeling of having missed out will be strong if it was all your decision. 

But, all in all, life has taught me that we are all so very different and it is very true that one man‚Äôs vision can be the opposite of another. But my personal advice remains: don‚Äôt be afraid to grow in life.[Basically](https://i.imgur.com/KA5GaEv.jpg)I decided that I will not to marry.

Some have mentioned they are quite happy to take care of your parents till their last minute,well it's a responsibility not a base of need. So why can't you all try, how it feels to go through the times both good and bad your parents had to go through? Sounds difficult! 

Yeah it is, that's why we all are here wherever we are. If this was some other country where the values of family, culture, respect and commitment are least important & parents actually have to take an appointment to meet their children, then your thought would have been right. I would have agreed. Whatever I say doesn't count unless you decide what you want with your life and if you have already decided, things like these would be the least of your worries

643,fumaxin,"This is the funny thing mate, instead of following my passion early on, I instead decided to focus on school and academics. I was able to get a better percentage in JEE mains, but again I can't code for shit.  So many young kids are so ahead of me today, it hurts.

This education system sucks ass.You don't necessarily need a graduation degree to success in life. Follow your passion. It will pay off.

Let me give you my example:

I was never good in studies. I applied for JEE but didn't give it because I knew I would never get a good college which I can afford.

Took admission for BCA, went to college just for one day and dropped off. Everyone told me that I HAVE to go to college and have a graduation degree to success in life. I disregarded them and followed my passion.

Now I make 24L/year working from home for a European tech company and you know what, they didn't even ask for my education in interview. Nor did my previous employer when I had joined them at age of 18.

World is changing fast, what matters is your skills and what you can achieve, not a piece of paper.Fancy college doesn't necessarily mean you'll be better than other kids. Just keep learning what you like. If you love CS, sky is the limit. All the resources are out there on the internet. Focus on improving your skills the right way.

You can study in any college, but just don't leave the Zeal. 

Learn from the right resources. 

Coursera is a good start to learn from professors from highly reputed colleges like Stanford, MIT etc., 

Value your time. If you are not gonna endup in a fancy college, that means you will have more time to vest. 

Read the right books,

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( SICP ) is a good first book to read. Although , pretty old, it improves your understanding of computers and programming in general. 

Follow right people, 

Read the blogs and works of computer scientists 
Peter Norvig's website is quite intriguing. 
Make a deliberate attempt to know and learn about the scientists working in your area of interest.

Be bloody damn good at what you do. Your career won't disappoint you. 

P.S : I work with colleagues who are commerce graduates and can code better than few of my so called fancy college graduates. 

You don't need to worry much. You are infact in the right track.I've given COMEDK myself in 2017 and it's not as hard as you make it out to be. The average question difficulty is lower than JEE Mains and BITSAT. I barely revised for a week from NCERT textbooks and I was able to place within the top 3000. If you've prepared for JEE somewhat seriously, you should be able to get a decent rank and a decent college.",1586263803.0,fwjxzy,AskIndia,12,/r/india/comments/fwjxzy/cse_students_please_help/,4,"Hey there. I am just getting mad to find a good college. The story goes like this:

Till class 8, I was good in studies. Then the first smartphone came into my house. My interest shifted to it. How android works, installing custom ROMs and all that stuff. Ruined class 9th. Back to track in class 10th. 89% in boards. Then in the meantime, I was interested in App Dev. At the end of 10th, I started learning some languages, but with no advice, I started with python for app dev. Studied KIVI lib but nothing useful in app dev. 

Then we were being taught C++ in school. So I started learning Android Studio with Kotlin. Developed some small apps like calc and some other. Also started Youtubing. Then after exploring the field, I was all into AI/ML. I just started learning Pandas and Numpy.  Results: Class 11th ruined. But this was not alone. I joined a bad institute, wasted my money and left(long story). So I stopped everything

Class 12th again back on track. Just gave my 12th examination(PCM, CS)..expecting 85-90%. But the thing is, it doesn't matter at all.

I gave JEE Mains first attempt(without studying). Got 75 percentile. The thing was I never knew there would be so much chaos for colleges. I don't want to take a drop, because I don't think I  can focus on preparing for entrances. I mean it has been one year, staying away from what I love. Also, my parents don't want to.

&#x200B;

So present scenario: 

Not filling JEE form for 2nd attempt is my big mistake. Registered for BITSAT. The problem is the 11th course. I am trying to do it, but it is like messing up my brain with so much to remember in one month. There are other entrances(COMEDK, VITEE) as well but all expensive private universities. There are good ones though, but my parents aren't satisfied with filling expensive forms CONSIDERING I am not even prepared. And it's not wrong. Even I don't have confidence in myself that I would clear one.

Any suggestion is highly appreciated.","CSE students, please help",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwjxzy/cse_students_please_help/
644,ouchmytongue,"Welcome to Indian kitchens. This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.

Edit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour!Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It‚Äôs a cultural thing. 

In older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

These days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.

Another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

Thank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. 

Hope this helps.Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..

1) eat slow
2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable
3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. 


Tried and tested in the field.
P.S: all techniques tested on my wife's family where I face the same issue.I am fasting today.Typical Indian household lol. It's endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can't walk or that I am going to throw up.

Just insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food.It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it.Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them ‚Äúyou guys also eat, I‚Äôll take how much ever I want, I don‚Äôt want to trouble you‚Äù) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face.Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness.The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - ""Yes, I do want more"". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don't want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don't worry, it's not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they'll think you're still hungry.Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don't understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it's clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don't like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs.Refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudelyan option is to tell them that because of the coronavirus thing you have started a special diet as you have more time or to enhance your health something. You may have to skip lunch entirely though.Fast for a dayI'd say it's better to say you're full, since it works like a charm for me. TBH it's my family hence I don't get pushed too often.It is typical of many families to insist one more portion to ensure even the meek leave with full tummy. Some hosts keep on feeding even if they might not have sufficient for themselves. They also believe that 

The way you‚Äôd refuse - once you have eaten to your liking, say that you liked it so much that you already are full to your heart‚Äôs content and do not have room for more. Say you don‚Äôt shy from food and if needed you‚Äôll ask for more by yourself (say this in a jolly tone). Also, as others have said, physically block them from serving another portion by holding your hand slightly above your plate or bowl. That‚Äôs an accepted way of saying you don‚Äôt want more.Tell them you have an upset stomach. That's what I do!Something I do, but only if people are very insistent: I yank my plate off the table and protect it with my hand until the other person retreats.

&#x200B;

This absolute last resort, but if your plate isn‚Äôt there, they can‚Äôt serve you.you should say that you are following very strict diet plan.Relax. It's just culture. You have to refuse lovingly, three or four times before they'll stop asking. Tell them you had something to eat already somewhere else.say you have allergies.Keep passing comments like,

* today the food is a little oily

* salt is less in the food today

* I think the gravy stinks, was it yesterday's dish you recycled?

* Roti could've been softer

*  Daal at the house next door at Sharma's is tastier


if they still offer you food. Quit

edit: Clearly this is being taken as a serious comment. I was in the mood to shit post. My bad.Take but don't eat. I know its not good to waste food but it's perhaps the only way. Ensure that the food gets wasted by may be mixing curries with staple, half eating sweets etc. When they ask you, say you are full and can't eat anymore. They will still continue giving excessive food to you for a few days. But then they will start paying heed to your words gradually.

661,doomedbijnissman,"i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

feel free to DM. i love to talk to fellow businessmen :)I don't have any advice that would help you. I just wanna say, be strong. This too shall pass!Stay in there buddy, you're young and that fire will bring you out. Whatever happens, don't quit,Difficult times bro! Stay Strong! A few questions:

1. Is your inventory perishable?
2. Can't it be sold domestically?
3. Not sure if this question is even correct - is it possible to go into a hibernation mode and then restart the business when things are better?

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

PPEs are mostly used within Covid isolation wards. Here the timeline is confusing. Did the heart patient come for heart treatment, and happen to have Covid? If the patient was suspected of having Covid - were PPEs not given because there was a shortage of them or the management refused to follow protocol? Is there no protocol for nurses to follow when they interact with each other after one of them comes in contact with a suspected Covid patient?

677,najyolo,"Well my parents are Hindus and even they switched off the lights out of fear of bhakt neighbours as well. But yeah I understand , this islamaphobia is only going to get worse the longer bjp stays in power.Yeah we're Muslims too and had to switch off all the lights because our colony went dark and people came out with diyas and started staring at our house.This is not just Muslims. Anyone who doesn't abide by what PM modi has said is looked down by his followers. 

It's the same when a radicalized Muslim look down upon a free and liberal muslim. For example, my friend who goes to jamaat look down upon all of us for not following religious instructions. He doesn't play holi and argues with those muslims who plays saying it's against Islam and why don't they adhere to preachings by their religious leaders. It has been everywhere in our society. Every section of our society suffers from it. 

And lighting diyas is nothing but an act of symbolism, that's it. And people who believe that this will cure virus are fools, and my request is stop worrying about them. These are the times to stand together. 500 cases/day now. And we don't know how many more are not tested yet.bro i am a muslim we live in a small town bhuj. 
the rss goons came out and chanted jaishree ram in front of our house we didn't turned of lights. 
they tried to threaten us but they didn't knew our whole family  lives in one compound  they backed off when my brothers and uncles got out of the house.

ps we were 12 and they were 5 or 6. 
it was never like this in our town man times were much simpler and peaceful. but now people are turning in to uncivilised goons.Welcome to New India (Ramrajya)... We can tear away the Constitution and throw it in Ganges. Kingdom ruling will be back soon in India.Ravish Kumar is so right. Modi has only brought out anti Muslim policies this whole time.As a muslim I completely second that, we also turned the lights off due to plain fear. People even yelled bharat mata ki jai and pakistan muradabad in my colony, now this is something next level.Even some Hindu families did it out of fear.I can a get a sense of how you are feeling.

Well, my elder brother who is a rationalist perhaps from the moment he was born, led our house to switch ON all the lights, all the appliances. The only house in our locality acting as a lighthouse in the sea of darkness. And ohh, we are Hindu btw. üòÑ

And then he went on to donate directly to our District labour commissioner's appeal for donations to help feed hundreds of migrant labourers who are stuck with nothing in our state.

An absolute madlad - a good rational one.Although it pains me that your parents feel this fear in a (no longer) democratic country, they did what it takes to survive. There will be other occasions to show meaningful resistance. Modiya's was such a stupid unnecessary dick move, it would have been a real pity if your parents had to somehow bear any cost for resisting this shit. We live to fight another day!Shoutout to my friend who kept his lights on using inverter even when there was a power cut.

PS: I kept my lights on tooIt is not Islamophobia, it is hatred for you they created among ignorant Indian youth.

This is the biggggggest democratic country for you babe!Meh, I couldn't give a shit about the lights.
Screw these bhakts. 
Can't live life in paranoia , the more you live with fear the more powerful THEY get.Was playing a ranked match in Rainbow 6 siege. Didn't have time to think about stuff like that.What makes you think anyone would have done anything? My society hardly paid attention to it. Some people were even mocking the idea of raising a flashlight. While I don't condone the behavior, its a free country and anyone can do as they please.

It's true that people have been increasingly hostile towards muslims because of the TJ issue and honestly it's inevitable when the national cases have shot up 30% at a time when everyone in the country is taking pride in the fact that we have a lower case-count than even the mighty Americans. The same reason why Chinese-American citizens in the US are targetted with hate crimes even though they've probably never set foot in China.

It's not Indians or Modi-Bhakts or right-wing nationalists. It's human beings. We're imperfect, broken souls who, for some reason, have to manifest their frustration at the uncontrollable into hatred for something or, more often than not, someone.

The only way for any of this to stop is if everyone together puts an end to segregation on religion, income, caste, etc. But, that will never happen because everyone needs to quantitatively compare one thing with another to find the best - whether it is themselves or something they have to select. We're fucked till the end of time, my friend.My parents live in a bhakt colony. There was a flat in the building opposite who didn't switch off the lights. People started screaming the flat name  (Flat 5 A lights band karo, Flat 5A Flat 5A!) after 9 o clock. They had to shut off the lights. It was insane. There were also chants of JSR JSR. It was like being in a dystopia. I feel you man, I'm sorry you feel unsafe.[removed][removed]same hereMy lights were on and I was playing video games. My roommates went to the balcony and lit cigarettes instead of diyas. :D

Thank god for South India where we have our own parties.I am sorry, really sorry that it has come to this.Even i had this fear. Thankfully, I live in a neighbourhood in Kerala where Muslims and the Hindus live quiet peacefully. No one bothered to switch off the lights. Some were out from their homes making fun and shouting Go Corona Go. I am glad i was born here.Peer pressure :PYo in Tamil Nadu the govt has instructed to take down the list of students who study in govt school whether they support the candle event or not.We were the only house in the entire neighbourhood who didn't switch off our lights.I didn‚Äôt switch off the lights for what it‚Äôs worth. Switched off other appliances though in case the voltage fluctuates.My lights were on, no one said anything :)

I'm a Muslim residing outside of India, I spoke to my parents today and it broke my heart. 

While everyone took part in whatever happened at 9 PM yesterday, my family took part in it entirely out of FEAR. Fear of being singled out if any of the lights in our house were switched on even by mistake. My mom switched off all the lights 5 minutes before 9 PM and double checked it, if she hadn't left anything on even by mistake. Call this paranoia or whatever, my family doesn't deserve this.

And, we live in one of the most safest neighborhoods in Mumbai.

I got banned last week for an answer to a question: Why are most of left journalists biased against India?

This was my response copy paste:

They're not. Indians are so conservative, so obsessed with culture and heritage that anything that even goes slightly against their traditions or establishment becomes left wing propoganda.

The most left leaning journalist in India would be considered right leaning in the western nations, and left journalists that you take for granted in Europe or America would get shot or stabbed in India within a week of publishing their articles or stating their opinion.

All these western companies will one day be run to the ground by Indians when they realize these Indians will not pay nor support them when the time comes.Quora is noxious. Full of bhakts and paid content. 

It can be useful sometimes if you have a specific question in some niche, but you shouldnt ever go there *looking* for good content[deleted]The worst thing about Quora is that it's high on Google search rankings.Well, Quora was great when it was a hidden gem but when the masses arrived there, it lead to mud.Indian Quora has turned into propaganda platform. Some dude posts a fake answer without any proof, then a tweet picks it up and then it goes on Whatsapp. Somewhere in between Deepak Chaurasia and Sudheer Chaudhary pick that answer and run it like a real news.> Quora is still fine if you read posts from non-Indian writers although it's sad that the quality of it has declined greatly. 

Lol, I agree completely, but I would have gotten skewered for writing this on Quora. Maybe there were bad writers from other nations too, but I never encountered them. Whereas the amount of garbage I came across from Indians was overwhelming.

The things you highlight are pretty much the reasons I left.  I joined Quora in 2014 - found I had a lot of free time, and it was my first experience with social media (wasn't active on FB, and had deleted my account by then). I ran out of patience 2 years later. People there pride themselves on the site being more intellectual, and there was the odd pocket of brilliance. But it was predominantly of equal quality to political Twitter, especially if you're Indian.I never have used it and I do not read answers from there as most of them are just copy/paste from other sources. Overall it's a shitty website because a lot of Indians are misusing it. Everyone there thinks they are Einstein or Newton just by answering a few questions. I left all social networking sites many years ago now I only use YouTube and Reddit.I now remember one more thing  - there were answers glorifying Nathuram Godse and agreeing with his motives.Why Quora when you've got reddit.It‚Äôs been taken over by the BJP IT trolls. The spread of hate is now become rampant in Quora and elevating Modi to some supernatural being seems to be the goal. Just today, someone posed a question, asking... don‚Äôt you think Modi is enlightened!!‚Äô  What‚Äôs more, an answer actually supported that!!!

I have thought of leaving. But decided not to. I want to push back. And so, to whatever ability I can, I will. 

( To the guy who answered that yes, it‚Äôs probable that Modi is enlightened, I passed an tongue-in-cheek comment that now in India people who have overseen pogroms against Muslims are considered to be enlightened!  The point is, people will read this and hopefully.... think! )Quora moderators are the extension of BJP IT Cell. Bhakts can comment anything, and if anyone take up that with Bhakts, their post will be removed religiously by Moderators, and appeal also doesn‚Äôt work with Quora (BJP IT Cell) Moderators.Zee News does point number 1Not sure if you know but I think you'll find r/indianpeoplequora interesting. It's mostly making fun of cringy posts from quora (political posts are I think not allowed though).Quora is nothing but 10% ""Sapiosexual"" Indians patting themselves on their backs for being slightly knowledgeable about a topic and 90% company employees selling their stuff to you by pretending to be unbiased researchersThe content quality had already gone down the gutter in 2014. Based on my experience on Quora, I think the IT Cell took off in 2013. Since 2014 was election year, they started spamming the platform with their propaganda. Everywhere, I'd only see talks of Gujarat Model and how Modi is an incarnation of God and will solve all of India's problems. Also, around this time, I saw many SEO and ""earn money online"" tutorials mention promoting blogs and content on Quora, Pinterest, Tumblr to get more clicks. IMO this too lead to a drop in quality. Everyone started doing self promotion.

EDIT: There was a highly popular question ""What is it like to have a weird surname?"" or something similar. It had an answer by an Indian girl whose last name was ""Lund"". I dont really remember what her answer was, but my classmates at the time found it very funny and thought it was a joke website and they all joined Quora in hordes. Soon after they started posting very retarded questions and answers.> put down as ""secular liberals"". 

No matter how much anyone calls me this, I'll never not see this as a complimentQuora is such crap ..earlier it was filled with iit shit .. now its filled with bjp and sexQuora has become BJP's extended IT cell.its just a bunch of hypocrites indian who consider themselves intellectual and above most of the population.There is quote I hear from every country's fellowman , ""Jaha indian jatey hai, Waha tatti karke atey hai!""[removed]Website: you need to log in with facebook if you want to read anything in our site after the first page.

That's on every single social media platforms, even on reddit.I have been there and still linger, 2014-15-16, pretty active years for me on Quora. I concur with you on the quality going down. We had a lot of high quality answers from people who were experts in their domain all you had to do was follow the topuc. Then came Indians. 

The  community raised concerns and Quora had to kind off work on the algorithm to keep Indians away from interacting with other communities and then they changed it again when that didn't work to upvote based recommendation algorithm if I am right and as of today, it kinds of tracks what you read and all. 

I have to be so careful with what I read, else I am bombarded with sub standard content. I don't want to read how you went into an IIM and how you are rich and travel the world and you are the best. 

I was there for something specific I thought I'd find interesting in my free time. But, that's not how it turned out.

Also, people never boasted about the upvotes they received, it was just it the answer. Now people go mad thanking and requesting to leave upvotes like it's  a temple donation.Join r/indianpeoplequoraSo is reddit.I see that everybody here feels that the quality of Quora has come down. I'd have shared the same opinion a year back. 

However, I started following different topics and people from other countries. Now my feed is always interesting. And if it's Indian content, I make sure it's from the featured top writers or highly upvoted or I ignore.

ProTip: It's not an iron rule, but only follow people if they're featured as a top writer / look at more than 5 answers and see if that's the kind of content you want on your feed, then follow.Give reddit a few years.

696,naveen_reloaded,"Full letter for those who have been hit by paywall :

>To,

>The Honourable Prime Minister,

>Republic of India.

>Respected Sir,

>I pen this letter as a responsible but dismayed citizen of our country. In my first letter to you dated 23rd March, I had urged the government to not lose sight of the plight of the unsung heroes of our society, the most downtrodden, the weak and the dependent. The very next day, the nation heard the announcement of a strict and immediate lockdown, almost demonetisation style. I was taken aback but I chose to trust you, my elected leader, the one we would like to believe knows best. I had chosen to trust you even when you announced demonetisation but time proved I was wrong. Time proved you too were wrong sir.

>Firstly, let me assure you that you are still the nation‚Äôs chosen leader and 1.4 bn Indians including yours truly will follow every direction of yours during this crisis. Today, there is probably no other world leader who has such a mass following. You speak, they follow. Today the country has risen to the occasion and invested its trust in your office. You must have noticed that even your naysayers clapped and cheered when you gave the call to do so in order to appreciate the countless health-workers working selflessly and tirelessly for the masses. We will comply to your wishes and orders but our compliance must not be confused as our subjugation. My own role as a leader of my people entails me to speak my mind and question your ways. Please pardon my lack of etiquette, if any.

>My biggest fear is that the same mistake of demonetisation is being repeated albeit at a much bigger scale. While demonetisation led to loss of savings and livelihood of the poorest, this ill-planned lockdown is leading us to a fatal combination of loss of both life and livelihood. The poor have nobody to look upto except you sir. On one hand you are asking the more privileged people to put up a spectacle of lights while on the other hand the poor man‚Äôs plight is itself becoming a shameful spectacle. While your world lit up oil diyas in their balconies, the poor are struggling to gather enough oil to bake their next roti. Your last two addresses to the nation had you trying to calm the people which is necessary in these trying times but there is something more urgent as well as important than that. These psychotherapy techniques can address the first world anxiety problems of the ‚Äòhaves‚Äô who have a balcony to cheer. But what about those who don‚Äôt even have a roof on their heads? I am sure you don‚Äôt want to be a balcony government only for the balcony people by completely ignoring the poor who are biggest constituent of our society, our support system and the foundation on which the middle-class, the well-to-do and the rich build their lives. The poor man never makes it to the front page news but his contribution to nation building both in spirit and in GDP cannot be ignored. He has a majority stake in the nation. History has proven that any efforts to destroy the bottom has led to the toppling of the top. Even science will agree here!
This is the first crisis, the first epidemic that the top of the society has inflicted upon the bottom. And the topmost, i.e, you sir seem interested in bailing out everybody but those at the bottom. As millions of daily wage labourers, house-helps, street-cart vendors, auto-rickshaw & taxi drivers and helpless migrant workers struggle to see light at the end of the tunnel, we seem to be securing only an already well-built middle-class fortress. Don‚Äôt get me wrong sir, I am not suggesting we ignore the middle-class or any one segment. In fact, I am suggesting the exact opposite. I would like to see you doing more to secure everybody‚Äôs fortress and ensure that nobody goes to bed hungry. COVID-19 will continue to find more victims but we are creating a fertile playground for Hunger(H), Exhaustion(E) and Deprivation(D) of the poor. HED ‚Äô20 is a malady that is smaller in profile but far deadlier compared to COVID-19.It‚Äôs impact will be felt long after COVID-19 has vanished.

>Every time there is a feeling that we have a chance to arrest the slide, you seem to be sliding into your comfort zone of unleashing a spirited election-style campaign idea. It seems you are comfortable outsourcing responsible behaviour to the common people and transparency to the State governments. This is the perception you are creating, especially amongst those who spend enough time working toward and intellectualising for a great today and tomorrow for India. I am sorry if I have offended you with the use of the word intellectual here, for I know that you and your government does not like that word. But I am a follower of Periyar and Gandhi and I know they were intellectuals first. It‚Äôs the intellect that guides one into choosing a path of righteousness, equality and prosperity for all.

>The focus on merely keeping people‚Äôs spirits alive through warm and fuzzy campaigning is probably leading your establishment into ignoring certain actionables that could actually save lives. Long into the epidemic, when the entire country‚Äôs law and order system had been primed, your system failed to stop congregations of ignorant and foolish people in different parts of the country. These have become the biggest hubs for the spread of the epidemic in India. Who is responsible for all the lives lost due to this negligence?
As per the Chinese government‚Äôs official statement to the WHO, the first confirmed case was reported on 8th December. Even if you concede the fact that the world took a lot of time to understand the gravity of the situation, by early February, the entire world knew that this is going to wreak havoc of an unprecedented kind. India‚Äôs first case was reported on 30th of January. We had seen what happened to Italy. Yet, we did not learn our lessons early enough. When we eventually woke out of our slumber, you ordered an entire nation of 1.4 bn people to shut down within 4 hours. A mere 4 hour notice period for the people when you had a 4 month notice period! Visionary leaders are ones who work on solutions long before problems become big.

>I am sorry to say that sir, this time your vision failed. Furthermore, your government and its appointees seem to be expending all their energies on a combative response to any feedback or constructive criticism. Sane, well-wishing voices with national interests in mind get quickly, intentionally and clinically drowned by the trolls of your army and are dubbed anti-national.
>
I dare anyone to call me an anti-national this time. The common populace cannot be blamed for being ill-prepared for a crisis of this magnitude but you can be and shall be blamed for this. The government is appointed and paid by the people to keep their lives normal and safe.

>Events of these magnitude get etched in history for two reasons, one being the devastation (illness and death) that they cause due to their core nature. The second being the long term impact of what they teach humans to prioritise and the kind of socio-cultural changes they bring about. I am extremely saddened to see our society plagued by an outbreak that is far more dangerous and longer lasting that any virus that nature has ever hurled at us.

>Sir, this is the time to listen to voices who truly care. I do care. It‚Äôs the time to smudge all boundaries and give a clarion call to everyone to come on to your side and help. India‚Äôs biggest potential is its human potential and we have tided over bigger crises in the past. We will overcome this too but it must be done in a way that brings everyone together and doesn‚Äôt become yet another reason to choose sides.

>We are angry but we are still on your side.

>Jai Hind.

>Kamal Haasan

>President

>Makkal Needhi Maiam

I recommend reading the whole letter. He raises very well and thoughtful points.

OP, please remember to add verified sources when posting images.Both Old India and New India: Republic of CasteBrahminism is at the core of hindutva politics from INC to BJP, never forget congress contribution to where we are todayThis is the reason Rajendra Prasad isn't rated too highly. He was too religious person.Any idea what the specific context is for the above cartoon?Ok Guys, newsfash. Indian Secularism is different from French Secularism. And how do you manage to have problem with a guy who no one in congress had any huge problems with.

And this was what, 70 years ago? He was religious, but he wasn't a casteist. He was however very wary of Nehru's tendency to get heavy handed when people seemed to be stopping him for ideological reasons. He had been a strong proponent of UCC right from the start, in absence of which he wanted the law to respect those traditions that weren't manifestly unfair. And not to mention he was quite learned in Islamic tradition, having studied under a Maulavi as well.

So, what is this then? If you castigate every hero of the movement for their apparently justified limitations, you're gonna find yourself out of heroes very fast, because humans are fallible.

710,abbawaddadu,"Every now and then, I too get flustered and my anxiety kicks in when I think too much about the current state of our country. The thing is, Indians are very unpredictable because this country works more on emotion than on logic. The tables have turned overnight in the past or it took 200yrs sometimes. 

But I do have a solution to calm your self and be at peace again. And that solution is the one quote I always make sure to read and remember.

‚ÄúWhen I¬†despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.‚Äù - M. K. GandhiHave you lit lamp yesterday?

Go Corona GoThe lighting of lamps and the clanging if utensils were a show of power by Modi. It was a warning to anyone who questions him or his party, he was showing off how much control he has over the majority of the population and how much weight his words carried amongst his followers. All its going to take is a pre recorded 5 minute speech to wipe out his opposition.No.. Indian sheeple will never have a revolution.. Don't think they will even vote different, partly out of fear and partly because they are easily manipulated by religion... So nothing will happen, don't worry. Of course, if you are end up on the 'wrong' side, prepare for some inconveniences - could be sorted by money, not standing out, having escape routes etc. If you are a conscientious lot, and feel that all this is wrong, just take a deep breath and accept it. Accept the worst case, maybe we see genocide in our time or unimaginable things. Nothing else to be done now - my anxiety is not going to affect anything except my ability to be prepared. Depressing thoughts, but this attitude helps me cope now.Simple solution: emigrate. This country is beyond help.No revolution is coming, our people is too servile for that.If you are a genuine Indian brought up in Independent India, that should be your thoughts now, unless....unless.. you are corrupted by saffron poison. 

If you drunk saffron poison, it‚Äôs difficult to ingest good thoughts into you. Saffron Poison drinker will not go alone, but he takes the entire community he belongs to, they destroys whatever comes across their path. That‚Äôs the power of saffron poison. 

Indians should wake up and spread anecdotes for the saffron poison, and eradicate the saffron poison and its creators and its benefactors altogether.The Roman empire, the French empire, the British empire, the Turkish empire all have turned to ash. Only their figments remain on earth to cast memories in minds of the people that anything built will eventually meet the dust. Only ideas and ideologies remain while flesh fades away. Anything build on sheer power, on trickery, on oppression and on greed will crumble-ash to ash, dust to dust- and eventually this regime set upon on these gruesome qualities will fall either by people or by time.....Honestly this feels more like the 3rd Reich than the French Revolution. We've already got the SA(not SS),the so called RSS. We're waiting for the night of the long Knives. And yes there were people,german people who protested to save jews,they were also killed. You can see the similarity here. only difference is that Hitler was named best leader by forbes for uplifting Germany from poverty and conducting massive industralization reforms,not which our counterpart is famed for.I really think India will have it's French revolution sooner or later. Because it's only going to get worse and worse. 
Someone somewhere is going to snap and that'll be the start.Your understanding of french revolution seems incomplete.. there has been no large scale debt hiding to start with. No one is thinking we are a super power and invincible... also, regime change happens every now and then in india.... also, democracy is functioning fine..Nope, for those who survive this will become water under the bridge in a few days .

These Nazis you elected to power were busy orchestrating a pogrom in Delhi, a mega show for the Orange man and toppling a government in MP, while the Covid-19 spread and no preparation was being done.>>Supply lines from abroad opened up today with the receipt of 1.70 lakh Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) coveralls from China which have been donated to the Government of India. Along with domestic supplies of 20,000 coveralls, a total of 1.90 lakh coveralls will now be distributed to hospitals and will add to the 3,87,473 PPEs already available in the country as of now. A total of 2.94 lakh PPE coveralls have been arranged and supplied by Government of India now.

>>In addition to this, 2 lakh domestically produced N95 masks are also being sent to various hospitals. Including these, over 20 lakh N95 masks have been supplied by Government of India. About 16 lakh N95 masks are presently available in the country, and this figure will increase with the fresh supply of 2 lakh masks.

>>Major portions of the fresh supplies are being sent to States with comparatively higher number of cases such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan. Supplies are also being sent to central institutions like AIIMS, Safdarjung and RML hospitals, RIMS, NEIGRIHMS, BHU and AMU.

>>The commencement of foreign supplies marks a major milestone in our efforts to procure personal protection equipment for the battle against COVID-19. An order for 80 lakh complete PPE kits (including N95 masks) had been placed on a Singapore based platform earlier and now it has been indicated that supplies will commence from 11th April, 2020 with 2 lakh, followed by 8 lakh more in a week. Negotiations are in final stages with a Chinese platform for placing an order of 60 lakh complete PPE kits, which will also include N95 masks. Separate orders for N95 masks and protective goggles are also being placed on some foreign companies.

>>Giving a further fillip to domestic capabilities, Northern Railways have developed a PPE coverall. This is in addition to the PPE coveralls and N99 masks developed by DRDO earlier. Efforts are now being made to start mass production of these products. Existing N95 mask producers have increased their capacity to about 80,000 masks per day.

>>Orders have been placed for 112.76 lakhs stand alone N95 masks and 157.32 lakhs PPE coveralls. Out of these, 80 lakh PPE kits will include N95 masks. The objective is to achieve a supply of about 10 lakh PPE kits per week. Looking at the number of patients in the country, sufficient quantities are available for the moment. Further supplies are expected within this week.

This person has single handedly jeopardize the lives 200 million people, with no fault of thier own.What did he think?Similar thing has been done by many bishops in Italy and Greece. No end to human stupidity.Tablighi jamaat split into two factions after a fight around 2 years back with moulana saad becoming the head. The other group is the one which canceled all the programs.

Darul uloom deoband had issued a fatwa against moulana saad 2 years back for his deviant views about some beliefs.

http://www.deoband.net/blogs/darul-uloom-deobands-fatwa-about-maulana-saad-kandhlawi-of-tabligh

>However, Maulana Haaris, another aide of Saad, defended his leader by saying that ‚Äúwhen our jamaats came from foreign countries, the Indian government allowed them to enter. How is it our fault?‚Äù

The fault also lies with the government. They came in last week of February without screening, now they are putting all the blame on him even though government didn't stop anything.

Tablighi jamaat concentrates only on people praying in mosques etc. So it's not a scholarly group.

The scholarly group is deoband madrassa where people study for 8-10 years. People should listen to proper scholars for guidance.

And for people who say don't listen to scholars etc, this is what happens when you don't listen.

And those calling for reformation and reinterpretation of Islam are even more deviated. It has resulted in groups like ISIS who are half baked terrorists who try to interpret it on their own for pure Islam ignoring the traditional scholars.""Advice"" alright, Should have ordered not advised in first place.",1586152251.0,fvt5rd,Coronavirus,20,/r/india/comments/fvt5rd/tablighi_chief_ignored_advice_of_clerics_on/,138,,Tablighi chief ignored advice of clerics on cancelling meet| India News - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tablighi-chief-ignored-advice-of-clerics-on-cancelling-meet/articleshow/75000760.cms

Some of you might remember this story. It's more of a catcalling story than a pickup line, but the finesse with which it was delivered warrants a mention. A rando catcalled me at a railway station. I don't recall what he said. I think it was something along the lines of 'bhagwan ne fursat se banaya hai' or 'kya item hai' or 'kya maal hai'. I replied with my usual line - 'ghar pe maa behen nahi hai kya'. To that, he immediately said, making a serious face, 'Hai na. Par aapke jaisi nahi hai'. I could help but laugh. He did too. We went about our merry ways.

Mine: ""I do desire we may be better strangers""[deleted]Once I was walking in college campus from hostel area to department building. I saw a very sundar kanya walking towards me, as she gets close, our eyes meet, sparkles spur out from our eye contact, and she smiles. I don't get a lot of action so I, unsure of what happened, kept walking in autopilot. I should've stayed there, but few steps in, I came back to my senses. I turned around and she was gone. disappeared. I wanted to go back and find her but my stupid brain told me it was getting late for class.


I have a habit of going to washroom before any lecture. I went to bathroom, reaching out to my pants zipper and I realised - it is open. It's *open*. I walked the entire way with my zip completely open.

All arguments are based on the point where Modi is to blame and where the blame lies on the stupidity of People.

The main villain of this whole act is lurking shadows, the one that drives Modi to do these magnanimous gestures and the Bhakts going a step further.

The Villain is Social Media and its cheap/immediate Validation of People's Acts.

Modi is a wave on the Ocean of time, the one who is using the potential of this villain to the maximum. Who can stop the next person to emulate or even elevate Modi's Acts ?

This villain has encroached upon every aspect of Human life, be it Parents filming children in their age of innocence for Validation, teenagers risking themselves for a thumbs up, adults taking stands that they might not believe in real life.

And Everytime this villain shows it's magic, the real issues take a background. 

Why even this post is a form of that villain, where validation received by Internet strangers will give a high of Temporary Happiness and a false sense of Achievement.

The Villain is here to stay, how we let it dictate us depends on our Choices.Have you ever driven middle of the night being so sleep deprived that you see road signs and trees waving at you and shit.

Pehle accidemt ke baad humne bike (bullet classic) theek karwai. Light wagarah sab change karwa liya. Mere thodi bhot lagi thi woh bhi 1-2 din mein dard kam ho gya. Toh hua yun ki hume Nubra valley jana tha toh petrol extra carry kar rahe the hum. About 10 litres. Woh jo plastic ke bade container aate hain na usme. Sab dhang se secure kar rakha tha elastic ropes se meri bike ke carrier pe (pta nahi saalon ne mujh pe trust kyun kiya) Hum log leh se subh 11 bje nikle aur khardungla cross karte karte late ho gye (another story for next time) toh hum sahi speed par chal rahe the nubra time se pahuchne ke liye kyunki iss baar hum raat ko ride karna nahi chah rahe the. Toh hua yun ki hum time pe nubra pahunch rhe the kyunki nubra ke road bhadiya hai. Bilkul straight roads hain toh speed sahi maintain ho gyi thi. Main sabse peeche tha bike column mein kyunki main speed jyada nahi karna chah rha tha due to the still fresh accident. Mere pichhe bas humari ek car thi jo log hume leh mein mile the. Isi beech ek cut aata hai minor sa ki bas thodi se derr ke liye road nahi dikhta hai aage. Jaise hi main woh cross karta hun pta lagta hai ek local aadmi gaadi ko single road ke thoda sa side mein park kar ke face wash kar rha hota hai. Gaadi dekhi, break lagaye. Pichla tyre wobble kara aur hum (main aur meri bike) phir se road pe slide kar rahe hain. (First accident ke karan ek tutti hui ball bearing ke karan)  Main 5-6 metre slide karke car ke bumper mein takrata hun face first (thank god for helmets). Mere piche ek aur riders ka group aa rha hota hai woh log rukkte hai. Aur mujhe utthate hain. Main khada hote hi bike dekhta hun toh pta chalta hai ki road ke side mein ek 6 foot ditch ke andar ulti padi hai (literally top down) aur fuel tank teedha hone ke karan fuel leak kar rha hota hai. Aur haan jo headlight nayi dalwai thi woh phir tutt jati hai. Aur majedar cheez, petrol ka can road pe gira hua hai bilkul khali. Saara petrol road pe gira hua hai. Ek spark aur sab jal jata. Hum log kisi tarah milke bike utthate hain aur phir kisi tarah apne home stay pahunchte hain jahan phir mujhe gaaliyan sun ni padti hain doston se.This is what late-night looks like.#4:20In hostel, this used to be around the time I used to go to sleep.

No. Surplus was passed on to the govt, as is always done. The surplus was much larger than normal this year so there was much media attention. But the RBI still maintains its buffer reserves. Don't speculate before you read about what was actually done.

> Are we going to run out of cash?

I don't think you understand what the RBI does. It's not responsible for importing goods, its buffer exists to stabilize the rupee exchange rate.War time emergencies? Where did you get that from? You seem to have a weird understanding of economics. Most of your questions don't make any sense whatsoever. Greece is a completely different thing altogether.

That money is surplus money the RBI had from its investment bonds and such. It became a part of the govt budget. That's all there is to it. 

No we are not going to run out of cash. That's not how it works at all. We are heading into a recession, along with every other country in the world.

Money is not this magic resource like grains that you keep locked up in RBI and you run out. Money is just a representation of labour. As long as the country is producing goods and services, that money will have value. Because of the crisis, there are lesser goods and services being produced, but it will eventually go back to normal.

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

749,ankitaggarwal64,"10+ hour gang.......i honestly believe that sleep deprivation is the biggest ignored/neglected root cause of health dangers that prematurely kill adults

ask me sometime about the role of sleep in the leptin ghrelin cycle and how its interruption destabilizes weight homeostasis

or about the new research showing that heart disease is not caused by fat, like we thought for years, but by inflammation in the circulatory system whose root cause is unknown but one of the prime suspects is, you guessed it, sleep deprivation

but nobody wants to hear that lack of sleep is killing people. employers don‚Äôt want to hear it. and god knows that having sold their waking hours to capitalism to survive workers don‚Äôt want to lose the only time they have left to them to live their lives, mostly stolen from sleep

REMINDER

- Humans are not meant to sleep for extended periods of uninterrupted sleep.¬†

By this I don‚Äôt mean¬†‚Äúhumans shouldn‚Äôt have 8+ hours of sleep a night‚Äù;¬†I mean that we are supposed to sleep for four to five hours (ish), then get up and do something relaxing like reading for a half hour to an hour, then get another bout of four to five hours. This is what our bodies were designed for.¬†

Sleeping the whole night through was a fad started with the advent of the lightbulb. Sleeping the whole night through is so recent (and artificial) that First Sleep and Second Sleep are mentioned in Dickens‚Äô novels.

- Lack of sleep for even a single night¬†severely compromises your immune system.

If you‚Äôre planning on getting little sleep or pulling an all-nighter, make sure to eat lots of fruit and veggies/take vitamins that day. Or even better, get yourself some bee propolis. It‚Äôs a natural remedy used for thousands of years¬†in Latin America and is insanely good for boosting up compromised immune systems (if you get the drop kind, put 3 to 4 drops in a spoonful of honey and mix well with a 2nd spoon to mask the strong taste). It has no side effects and is all but impossible to overdose¬†on.

- According to several government bodies around the world, chronic lack of sleep is literally tied for¬†1st place as the worst kind of torture (the other is solitary isolation)

- Expecting a teen to get up for 8:30 classes is the equivalent of expecting an adult to be at work at 4 am.

After babies, teens are the age group that needs¬†the most amount of sleep. Puberty is exhausting, and the body needs time to recharge. Ideally, a teen should be getting between 10 to 12 hours of sleep at the bare minimum. Most teens are lucky if they manage to get 8. And that‚Äôs a gigantic problem; not only does lack of sleep affect mood (which is extra significant when your hormones are already riding a rollercoaster to begin with), but also has massive effects on growth, which is kinda what the whole puberty thing is supposed to be about.

- According to research¬†‚Äústarting work before 10 a.m. is tantamount to torture and is making staff sick and stressed‚Äù 

- Humans were not designed to have the same sleep cycle across the species. Much the opposite in fact.

Night owls and morning people are an actual thing. Because we‚Äôre pack creatures, Nature came up with a clever way for our ancestors to always have someone on the lookout for predators and threats: make people naturally alert at varying times so that there‚Äôs always someone alert to keep watch.¬†

Forcing night owls to follow morning people‚Äôs sleep cycle means night owls live with what researchers have referred to as ‚Äúpermanent jetlag‚Äù.

‚ÄúAdults need less sleep‚Äù means¬†‚Äúadults need 8-9 hours and teens need 10-12,‚Äù not¬†‚Äúadults need 6 and teens need 7-8.‚Äù¬†

There's nothing so far that you can do. The onus is on your boyfriend. Indian parents, for the most part, in situations like this, will eventually mellow out if the son takes a strict no nonsense attitude. Which is difficult for some Indian men. Being so reliant on the parents as they are.

Even if they come around which will be unwillingly it is still going to be difficult for you for some initial years of marriage. 
Just ignore them, get court marriage done. They will try to emotional blackmail your guy, hope he is smart enough to ignore that.
Don‚Äôt give in to all the drama of ‚Äúwe are your parents, we did so much for you etc etc‚Äù. 
Just get married and let them come to terms with this on their own.
It is your life and you both are the one who are going to spend it for the rest of your life.

And if he is NRI then it becomes easy to get married. 
But if the boy is from India and you have to get married in Indian court of law then the process is a bit tedious but doable.You cannot make every one happy. If you guys are happy together, you will be miserable apart. 

Give them space and time. If after sometime, they still don't listen, take a call. 

Happiness together or misery apart.

Either way, take care and stay safe.How fucked up is it that there's a post like this every month? Just tells you about the priorities that Indian Parents have. Good luck OP.Damn i am a telugu indian...spare with my english..ykr.... 

Basically (no offense to any one)  Brahmin caste is highest in the hierarchy in inian caste system and particularly too orthodox with their traditions customs ect....In indian it's sad but marriages occur inside same castes...but there are exceptions in some cases were people get married to foreigners too.... All indian parents are like that(as u explained) .....basically but u need to figure out how  his parents are ...........

1(completely orthodox) these people don't care about their son or daughter but only Honour ..caste and religion always comes into their mind  ..if his parents are like this then u are doomed..........

2(little liberal)they care about their son's happiness even sacrificing their honour....take time ...meet them... don't be like typical American...search about ethical wear,customs and traditions of telugu community..meet them in saree if possible..talk to them maturely not like a child  ..try to impress them.. try to be honest and they will accept u.......

in general sense indian men are good..... So don't loose him if he sincerely loves u...all the best...and (checkout about dowry).Arey Yaar kya hai Yaar, arey ye kon hai yaar?Why do I always find western woman wanting to be with Indian men asking advice on r/india rather than r/ABCDesis ?

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

TL;DR how to convince somewhat religious Telugu-American parents to go easy on their son for choosing a non-Indian girl and at least give us a chance?",How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvgj13/how_do_i_get_my_boyfriends_parents_to_give_me_a/
